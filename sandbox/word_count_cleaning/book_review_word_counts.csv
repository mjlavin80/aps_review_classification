1,"                                                                                                THE GADFLY.*                 DEARTH of good novels has been felt this year, so with unalloyed pleas-                 tire wve recognize in Mr. E. L. Voynich a new writer of exceptional ability, and in TYe Gaffy an intensely interesting and dramatic novel. Although not equal to Quo Vadfis, it is yet the most powerful story which has come to us since Sienkiewicz's remarkable book.                 The scene of The         is laid in Italy, modern Italy, the Italy of Garibaldi, and there is much in the experiences of The Gadfly which recalls Garibaldi's own ex- citing career. The fierce struggle between the eager young group of revolutionists and the ecclesiastical or conservative party- this is the leading motif of the book. Blut the reader s interest centers chiefly in two strong and original character s-The Gad- fly and the Padre Monticello.                 When we are first introduced to The Gadfly lie is an idealistic, sensitive young student called Arthur, sitting at the feet of his adored preceptor, Monticello, who is a priest famed for his nobility of character alld pureness of life. The political move- ments of the day awakened the young man s  enthusiasm, and his presence at cer- tain political gatherings caused his arrest. D)uring his imprisonment efforts were made to  hiid to betray his political friends -efforts  by torture,-but be was brave enough to keep their secrets.  released he found that words he bad uttered under the seal of the confessional had been the means of betraying his best friend. Weak and discouraged with long months in a dungeon, Arthur came out to find that the girl be loved-Gemnia-be- lieved him to be a coward, and that his adored Padre Monticello was the seducer of his mother, and that lie himself was only a child of shame. This accumulation of misfortunes drove him nearly out of his mind with grief and rage, the  world seemed to him a cheat, and God a gigantic fraud. Leaving behind him a bitter note                 'The Gadfly. By E. L. VWynich. Henry Holt & Co.                 for the Padre, the youth Arthur retires from the scene-sailing as stowaway on a steamer for South America.                 Thirteen years later there arrives in Italy a bitter and cynical man, reckless of his own life and regardless of the lives of others, ""a gentleman of many adventures and unknown antecedents,"" whose attitude toward the church and its priests, especially toward Monticello, is one of ineradicable hatred. Frightful sufferings both mental and phys- ical, sufferings  have scarred his body and. wrecked his nerves, have turned the, noble pure-minded youth into a - tive, heartless man.                 The weakest point in the novel is the transformation of Arthur into The Gadfly. Ought Lot the writer to have prepared the reader for this change of character by show- ing evil traits in the youth which might de- velop into wickedness in the man? Arthur is too virtuous to seem quite natural, and The Gadfly is too base. The laws which should govern the evolution of character are disregarded here, and circumstances are made responsible for all of The Gadfly's sins.                 And what a remarkable, original charac- ter The Gadfly is! A perfect dare-devil! There is nothing wicked and cruel that the embittered atheist does not attempt. He has a courage born of a contempt for life. His desire for revenge is relentless. The love and tenderness that were in his heart have turned to gall and wormwood.                 The last half of the book is written with unusual dramatic power. It is full of novel adventure and incident. The Gadfly be- comes the leader of the Revolutionary party. He is constantly brought into association with Monticello and Gemma, but for a long time is not recognized. The account of his final capture and his death, with all its har- rowing details, is almost too painful to read. Some of the last scenes, the prison scenes, are exquisitely touching. The meetings be- tween the father and the son are bitter and passionate. The moment when Monticello recognizes in his insulting prisoner-who is before him awaiting his death sentence- his lon-lost and much sorrowed-for son, is an intensely thrilling one. The Gadfly tells the Padre to choose between his son and his God, and even at such a moment as this cannot forbear to denounce the church and its priests.                 The writer has a forceful style, an entirely original conception for his plot, a wealth of unhackneyed incidents, and several strong characters. Gemma's calm and serene na- ture and breadth of view make of her a woman of a new and noble type. Even the gypsy woman, whom The Gadfly had attached to himself, is alive. With a few powerful lines Voyniich is able to portray living, breathing, human beings.                 In the last chapters we deplore a certain diffuseness in style, a lack of restraint, as if                 the writer did not know how to end his book artistically. Once The Gadfly disappears, the reader s interest wanes.                 It is a powerful and picturesque story, however-a canvas glowing with color and life -and the few striking characters stand out in firm, resolute outlines. We heartily commend Tue Gadfly as a clever, almost a brilliant, novel.

By Captain John A. Lockwood, U. S. Army. Kansas Coty, Mo.: Hudson-Kimberly Co., 1903.                 Captain Lockwood has here presented a useful little volume to aid the cadets of military academies and colleges in their duties. The interest in the subject of military education in this country is certainly increasing, hence the handbook wvill be welcomed by a large and constantly increasing class of students.                 The book considers not only the subjects of direct and immediate interest to such students but also subjects of general military importance, such as discipline, organization, correspondence, reports, rosters, courtsmartial, nilitary engineering, military hygiene, first aid to the wounded, camping anId marching. It is well illustrated, particularly the chapters on military engineering, an(d first aid. The appendix contains the Articles of \Var and the blank forms necessary is company and post admistration.                 Tlhe last two chapters are devoted to WVest Point and tile methods of obtaining comimnissions in the regular army.                 It is altogether a viseful, convenient aind timely little volumsse, which should prove effective in increasing the scope of military knowvledge, in a practical way in our ordinary academics and colleges, great and small, as well as in those dlevoted specially to military instrutioll.

The book has been edited for a text-book, and contains the Anglo-Saxon text,. carefully compiled from the standard editions; an introduction and excellent notes, as helps3for the student; a very complete glossary and the Latin original. Elene, as a poen, is one of the simplest in AngloSaxon literature, and especially recommends itself in that some of the most interesting portions are of the author s own conception.

It will prove highly serviceable to the student and interesting to the casual reader, in that it gives a correct idea of Anglo-                 Saxon composition. It contains, besides the Elene, translations of Judith; Athelstan, or the Fight at Brunanbush; and Byrhtnoth, or the Fight at Mfnldon.                 THE LIFE OF LIVINGSTONE. BY Taos. HIuciis:.

By JAs. T. BixnY. (Cml -                 CAGO: CHAS. 1I. KnRR & Co. $0.30.)                 The nineteenth century has been the age of scientific inquiry; and as it advances, science invades the territory of the established faith. Even now it has become an absorbing question which will succumb and, if neither, how they will be reconciled. Mr. Bixby's excellent work-excellent because neither abstruse nor tedious nor filled with scientific terminology-deals not with the bare facts of either sense or religion, and questions not whether the biblical creation is the same as that of geology nor whether evolution is consistent with the idea of a parental Adam. But he sweeps a broader field. He defines both, confident that when rightly understood all antagonism will be eliminated. Me discusses the common foundation of the two, the similarities of their methods, objects and results. The work is a philosophical treatment throughout, and gives an admirable statement of the question in a clear and accurate light.                 LA  FRANCAISE AU DIX-SEPTItME . EDITED                 By TiIOMAs FREDERICK CRANE, A. M. (NEW YORK AND LoNDON: G. P. PUTNAM S SONS. 1.50.)                 -Mr. Crane's book consists of a selection of extracts from the contemporary French writers of the seventeenth century; not chosen for their literary excellence, but for the light they will throw upon the social development and social influence which arose in that century. It was then that society, as society, began to be cultivated; it was then that woman took her position beside man as an intellectual companion; then that the modern salon began its development and conversation became a fine art. It is of the social character of the period that the book treats. It is a study which serves as a commentary to such writers as Corneille                 and Molitre, and by which the Femmes Savantes and the Pr6        Ridicules are invigorated with a new life. The text iB in French, accompanied with very full historical and explanatory notes, accompanied with a prefatory introduction critically describing the period and its prominent personages.

In the questions and responses of the supposed guests (which are taken  from their published works), the strength and superior merit of the religion of Christ is conclusively proved, and the question which gives the name to the book is answered in the negative. As giving in compact form the opinions of all the greatest thinkers in this most vital of all subjects, its value will never grow less.                 KNICKERBOCKER NUGGETS.

The first of these volumes contains a selection of the most memorable passages in Sidney Smith's writings and conversation, which are a continual change of sentiment, and prove a most spicy and agreeable feast. The four tales selected from Heinrich Zsclhkke's many excellent stories are representative of the best German talent il this direction, and, indeed, rank as equals with the standard works of authors of other nations. They have been translated especially for the Alessrs. Putnam, and the last, "" Walpurgis Night,"" has never been in print in the English language before. These same publishers have recently issued in different form from the "" Nugget "" series, GIa.AT WoRns FROM  AMEmIciANs, which is thesame as the"" Ideals of the Republic"" (issued as a nugget and which we have noticed before), except that they have added to this book Washington's circular letter of congratulation and advice to the governors of the Thirteen States. This book is of slightly larger size and less elaborateness of binding than in the former edition.                 SEVEN THOUSAND WORDS OFTEN 'MISPRONOUNCED. By Wbi.                 H. PuIYFE.

The two leading books in the series are intended especially as school                 text-books. This, the final volume, may be used as an educator to "" children of a large growth,"" or as a reference book in the library of the gentleman. It includes an unusually large number of proper names and words and phrases of foreign origin. Its treatment of mooted questions is firm and authoritative, and the author does not shrink from the difficult, as do so many, hut his book is the dispenser of true enlightenment in this line.

The author proves in a logical way that "" Massachusetts is still open to students of its geography and early history ;"" and on account of the interesting information regarding the explorations and settlements of the Norsemen in the New World, it will be read with avidity by students of history. The text is embellished by many maps and by a few  representing ruins and other evidences of Norse occupation.                 TWO GREAT  OF HISTORY. GnoTrE AND SEouR. (BosTON:                 Gl1N & Co.) -                 Messrs. Ginn & Co. have issued another volume in their "" Classics for Children "" series, which contains Grote's account of the Retreat of the Ten Thousand, and Count Segur's narrative of Napoleon's Retreat from Russia. Notes and maps are given, illustrating the two routes, and each selection is prefaced with an introduction, which gives all the information necessary to the proper understanding of the accounts which follow. These selections form one of the most valuable of this series and make the book fit, not only for the nursery, but also for the family reading room. It is a book which every family should possess.                 A HOLIDAY TOUR IN EUROPE. By JOEL COOK. (PI[:                 DAVID MCKAY.)                 This is a new edition of Mr. Cook's ""Holiday Tour,"" which was so well received ten years ago. The new and beautiful binding, and the engravings which have been added to the subject-matter, increase the pleasure with which we read the book and make its contents more intelligible to one who has not seen for himself the scenery therein portrayed. The style and contents of these letters are too well known to need description, and we can only say that the next best thing to going to Europe oneself is to read these letters descriptive of Mr. Cook's tour.

While there is no lack of advanced text books on this subject, we have noticed that there is need of an elementary book, which has been filled by this volume. The book is intended especially to give the discoveries and advances in this science of the last ten or twelve years in a more condensed and compact form than is to be found in the. advanced text books on this subject. Mr. Thomas A. Edison approves of the treatment and says that the facts given therein can be relied upon.                 THE ACADEMIC ALGEBRA. BY  & EMERY. (BOSTON:                 Tmons%'soN, BROWN & Co.)                 This is an excellent text book and calculated to prepare thoroughly a man for college. It is especially designed to meet the demand for a fuller treatment of factoring and for a higher treatment now required in our high schools. We especially commend the treatment of positive and negative numbers, and of the interpretation of negative results, and of                 O A 0                 the forms and                 THE WATER-SPIRIT S BRIDE. By CHmAs. J. BAYNE. (NEW YORK:                 JOHN B. ALDEN.)                 Air. Bayne is a Georgian of eighteen summers. His poems show that his poetic genius has not matured but in many places gives evidence of                 natural ability. These children of his brain are, he informs us in a very happy preface, ""'The Autobiography of his Soul,"" which has, he leads us to believe, been harassed by ""joy and grief, love and hatred, hope and fear."" Perhaps a few lines  serve the purpose of showing one phase of his style:                 ""Fl , loo. are bl- ,                 Kissed by the -tn  air; While, like so  Graces, ill                 Likecd ha-d in hand, p--rse the ball. 0,  of ,rn ce,,est ,                 Ca,, sach delight belong to atr?,                 AN HONEST HYPOCRITE. BY EDwARD DP GRoTR ToSrNKINs. (NEW                 YORK: , & Co. i0 CENTS.)                 Among many of the younger novelists of to-day there is a tendency to write their novels and then select as striking a name for the title as possible. They seem to be free from any conception. of the higher motives of the novelist, and care even less about the more artistic aim of portraying a fine character in a picture of real life. Only in the name of  book does Mr. Tompkins come under this censure. That certainly is striking, almost a paradox, but he has not lost sight of the duty of a novelist, nor lacked ambition or ability to paint a fine picture.                 KING S HANDBOOK OF NEWTON. By M. F. . (BOSTON:                 MNosES KINo CoRPoRATIoN.)                 Contains the most notable and interesting facts pertaining to the fifteen villages which together form ""' The Newtons,"" the garden city of Massachusetts. It is written in a simple, entertaining and trustworthy mariner, and made attractive by many illustrations.                 CLEOPATRlA. By H. RlnD.sR HAGGARD. (NEW YORE AND CHICAGO:                 RAND,  & Co.)                 Mr. Haggard appears before us in this, his latest production, in his best form. We note the same wealth of imagination, power of description, fine command of the English language and flavor of the marvelous which characterize his world-renowned "" She."" Added to this, he takes for his heroine an historical beauty, round whose name have always clustered tales of love and treachery. There is certainly nothing highly instructive in this novel. but one cannot read its pages without absorbing interest, and feels that the author is a master of his art.                 THE TENTS OF SHEM. BY GRANT ALLEN. ( AND NEW                 YORE: RAND,  & Co.)                 In this age, when cheap and flashy novels flood the country, we soon learn to appreciate true merit wherever seen. This work is one of the                 best ever published by this company, both in spirit and in letter. The scene is laid in the Kabyle Hills, and the heroine is a half-English, half-Kabyle maiden, who wins our hearts at first introduction. The tone is high, and the book will repay reading.                 FIRST STEPS IN ENGLISH LITERATURE. By ARTiHuR GILLMAN.                 (A. S. BARNES & Co.)                 ,Mr. Arthur Gillman's "" First Steps in English Literature,"" which was first published about twenty years ago, has  revised by the author and put on the market. Hle purposely excludes extracts, but supplies a list of editions, Mr. Gillman gives a philosophic outline, with brief Recounts of writers both in England and America, and does not dole out admiration and literary criticism with a spoon. The scheme at once met approval from the most capable instructors, and the book has held its place in many schools since its first appearance.                 The same publishers also announce ""The Three Germany's,"" by Air. Theo. S. Fay, a book of much merit and calculated to become a standard work.                 A NAMELESS WRESTLER. BY JOSElP1lNE, W. BAIlS. (P11)EI,                 rn A: J. B. LpnIrrcorr & Co., $0.50.)                 A book especially attractive to those interested in the great Northwest. The plot is laid in the State of Washington, and in its development brings out some of the most attractive features of the Pacific Coast. The story, while it embraces of a love element, yet contains some graphic descriptions of the rough and readiness of frontier life. The heroine, Juan Fonnimore, after bearing her many crosses, in the end shines out in the full beauty of womanhood. The story is one of interest throughout.                 THE ELIXIR OF LIFE. (BOSTON: J. G. CUrPLESC O. $0.60.)                 All reading classes have at the present time been interested, either by the medical or secular press, or both, in the results, method and promise of Dr. Brown-Sequard's recent striking experiments with an agent popularly known as the "" Elixir of Life."" This little book has been compiled to give the opinions of all classes, placing within reach of all, in a handy and condensed form, all filets of interest connected with the subject. It contains "" Dr. Brown-Sequard's own account of his famous  remedy for debility and old age, Dr. Variot's experiments, and contemporaneous comments of the profession and the press.""                 WHAT IS TRUTH? BY TIHE DUKE or AnuYLL. [(NEW YORK: ANsoN                 D. F. RANDoLPHn & Co.]                 This is one more contribution to the discussion of a subject upon which so much has been written and so much thought expended. It is                 a subject which will ever deserve investigation and which each generation will of necessity ask itself. This treatise is in the form of a lecture delivered by request to the students of the University of Edinburgh. After treating of Truth in the abstract and defining it, starting with the definition offered by George II Lewes, the author proceeds to apply analysis, which he, with much elaboration, argues is the best method in seeking , to three departments, namely, that of Politics, that of Physical Science, and that of Religion. He closes by showing how perfectly his )tion harmonizes with the definition with which he began.                 THE . By EiZBETIf )D)ARD). (NEW YORK: CA8ssEI.I                 AND) COMPANY, LIMITrED.)                 This little story comprises a detailed account of the various changes in the fortunes of ""The 'Morgesons,"" a very peculiar family, whose members could never understand each other.                 Cassandra Morgeson, who tells the story, relates some quite pleasant incidents in connection with her boarding-school life. The story is decidedly New England in its coloring, and brings out some peculiar customs of a quarter of a century ago in that interesting section of our country.                 The style is pleasing, and, as a whole, the book is capable of affording considerable amusement to its readers.

A happier combination of author and illus- trator could hardly have been hit upon, but it was quite evident that the half-tone process employed in repro. ducing the pictures did scant justice to the beauty of Mr. Parrish's originals. We are glad to note that the publisher (John Lane) has now brought out a new edition of the book, with the illustrations reproduced in photogravure. The result is a great improvement in every way over the original edition, the volume being hardly less charming from the artistic than the literary standpoint.                 The volumes of the ""Mermaid Series"" of English dramatists, in their neat new issue, are coming to us thick and fast. The latest publications are Webster and Tourneur in one volume, edited by J. A. Symonds; Middleton, in two volumes, edited by Mr. Swinburne; Massinger, in two volumes, edited by Mr. Arthur Symons; Ford, edited by Mr. Havelock Ellis; Hey- wood, edited by Mr. A. Wilson Verity; and Dryden, in two volumes, edited by Mr. George Saintsbury. The Dryden is a new work, having never before been in- eluded in the series. These books are imported by the Messrs. Scribner.                 It is with much satisfaction that we record the pub- lication, by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co., of Volumes XV. to XVII. of their ""New International Encyclo- ."" These volumes complete a work of which we have frequently had occasion to speak in terms of praise, and we only now add that such use as we have thus far made of it for purposes of reference has more than borne out our first favorable impressions. There is certainly no better work of the kind for general and popular reference now upon the market, and it has the additional advantage over all its competitors of being the most strictly up-to-date. It is equally satisfactory from the three standpoints of conciseness, readability, and attractiveness of dress and illustration. It comes near to being an ideal work for the family and the school.

In especial, the  ones stand for their  s's                 ideals ot lite, religion, and work; first, a purification of the Roman Catholic Chuich, and then the active participation by Roman Catholics in the progressive religious, so ial, and political life of our day. In other words,                 men should be as broadly as they are intensely religious. But, aside from this, the Fogazzaro novels are good to read because of the characters therein depicted; these seem more like ourselves than do those of                 most novels of Italy, whether written by ltalian romancers from Manzoni to Verga or hy foreign novelists from Hawthorne to Alairion Crawford. In ""Piccolo Moondo Antico'' for instance, the characters, especially tiw minor ones, have a , pathos, , and quiet humor which remind one now of Dickens, now of Fritz Reuter.                 lI  Mondo Antico "" has reached its fort\-fourth edition in Italy-a sufficient  concerning its popularity. Perhaps it  the nearest to being a historical  of any of Fogazzaro's novels. It represents ""a little old world,"" for its scenes are practically confined to the  shores of the Lake of Lugano during the Austrian occupation half a century ago. Those  days for Italy are well depicted, and, while the novel does not portray all the historical scenes which one might expect, it does throw a valued side-light on them. The hero, Don Franco, is none other than Signor Fogazzaro's father, and the heroine Luisa is his mother. Don Franco is hardly so much a ""patriot ""-to use the rather misleading title of the translation-as he is a religionist, a type of the Church in its conflict with Untelief; he prefigures "" 11 Santo,"" published in  as ""The Saint,"" the third member of the trilogy of which "" The Patriot"" formis the first. A translation of the second, "" l  MNondo Moderno,"" is in press and is to be entitled "" The Sinner."" The trilogy is the more remarkable because it was unconsciously evolved rather than consciously planned. The "" Antico "" is not Signor Fogazzaro's greatest work. While it contains  striking descriptions of , recalling the author s ""d Icllii,"" and while in plot, character-, and style it is superior to his "" Malonibra "" and "" Mistero del Poeta,"" it toes  equal his "" Daniele Cortis."" which in these respects stands well-nigh unexcelled among novels dealing with present-dav Italy. As to the  edition of the "" Antico,"" though the vigorous translation ma' tally with the dictionary, it does not   the novelist s originality of expression anl atmosphere.

Mr. Cabot Lodge hba given us an excellent volume on him, Mr. Adams another. His works have been , and now in Mr. Morse's Amierican Statesman we have another Life, by John Austin Stevelns (Houghton, Mifflinl, & Co.) It was of Mr. Oallatir, that Judge Mtorv, who was accustomed to weigh his words, wrote, ""I  him side by side with Alexander Hamilton."" Yet he knew                 that at the time of the Wbiskey InsurrectIons iu Peonsylvania Hamilton scoured the west  with writs and soldiers, not without some hope of catching the young Genevan in hill net. Of the three great  who led and ruled the Republican  of the day, he drew on himself the  animosity of the Federallsts. Ho was holder than Madieon, and endowed with more practical  than Jefferson. Ile excelled Hamilton in  power, and in the technical command of the principles and  of finance. Notwithstanding their political differences, he pursued  the same pollcy as Hamilton, and in the impression lie was to make on the whole subsequent financial history of the country was his successor and  on equal terms. Mr. Htevens i]oes not add much to what we  of him, nor change the  already expressed by Mr. Lodge. The merit of his work Hes in the  and separate treatment of Mr. Gallatin'sfl  policy, especially as to banking, the currency, and the question of tariff, and the policy of protective duties. Mr. Gailatin was a iian of great  as well as Of skill and tact. Ito dared to differ with his  in thie 1 triumvirate anl with his chief 1ii the Cabinet, and even to go to the extreme off voting with the Federalists. HIs views amid his action as to the non-political administration of the Civil Service, and his attempts to save it from prostitution to political ends, show both his courage and his prescience. Both Jeffersoim and Madison, as Mr. Stevens explains,  Mr. Clallatiiis ""  of a principle which  since been the base of every attempt at reform in the Civil Service."" Mr. Jefferson, by his duplicity and trifling, throw away his opportunity to prevent the  Of patronage from  dowm onl the American system. But it will require  proof to establish the assertion, which we tind on. p. 290, that ""the Federalists had not 4ted to confine the patronage of the Executive to men of their own way of thinking."" We rather wonder that, among the services of Mr. Qallathi, we find nothing said of his relation to the Coest Survey. From a biographical point of view there is a groat  of matter In this volume to interest the general reader, though the plait breaks up somewhat its unity, alnd requires some repetition. Mr.  was always brilliant and interesting, alid his life is not  romantic features. He WHs in many respects the typical Republican, living  and dying poor. with the wealth of a great nation in his hands. It Is of him that the story is told, which might be incorporated into MIr. Stevens's , that to a generous offer of the banker Alexander Baring, he replied that a man who had the  of the  of a country as long as he had should not die rich.

Each volume is a unit in itself, as references are not made from one volume to another by section and article numbers. This arrangement allows the use of any one volume without reference to the others.                 The book consists of eight sections. The first, comprising about one-third of the book, is devoted to the general theory of measuring and determining the nature of the stresses in framed structures and beams induced by the various conditions of supports and loads. It covers the principles of statics, reactions, moments and shears in  and trusses and influence lines. This section is unusually complete. The remaining,  are devoted to methods of computing stresses in roof trusses and bridge trusses, lateral trusses and portal bracing, deflection of trusses and the stresses in redundant members. Of particular importance to architects are the sections devoted to statically indeterminate frames, wind stresses                 in high buildings and rectangular tower . Appendix A consists of equations giving the moments in statically indeterminate frames most  used when subjected to various loads. Appendix B gives the derivation of fundamental equations for analysis of statically indeterminate frames.                 Many illustrative problems are given  which add to the  of the book. The illustrations and diagrams are very clearly drawn and of a scale  large to be easily read. The typography and general make-up arc of the same high character that is found in the volumes already issued. In every part of the book is shown a successful intention to make this volume of such a scope that it will completely serve the needs of the structural engineer. The book should find a place in every architect s and  engineer s library.                 Stresses iii Fraoned Structures. Editors-in-chief: George A.

The limitations of the field lie in other directions, and Mr. Rees, who is not at all of the sallow and gangrene school, but would rather draw the honest tears of the , has recognized these limitations and has compromised with them in introducing into the life of Chun Tikung (X) an English girl, who becomes the Chinaman's wife. A Caucasian romancer about Chinamen will realize                 the most readily at how few points intelligent Caucasian sympathy touches Chinese life. It is true that even in the Middle Kingdom, Heaven still sends small children with hearts such as it would have the hearts of men; and  is universal testimony to the charm of little pigtails. But the charm fails inversely with the pigtail s growth. The first serious undertaking of the Chinese youth, when he enters the native school-room, where he is tapped loudly on the skull when memory fails him, strikes us as no more than comic. We know that on the other side of the sphere most things are inverted; but nevertheless we do not readily entertain the fact that upside-down methods are for the greater part as practical there as our methods are here. Then, if we pursue the student in his strivings to fit himself for the ruling rank, solely by cramming himself with the classic verse and epigram of his tongue, he excites merely our intellectual contempt, even though he be learning all the wisdom of ages of his people that can be held in words. Meantime the  of his marriage and the religious doctrine that decrees it we find appalling, even if we grasp how this wonderfully virile and self-perpetuating doctrine of  has been the warp of the Chinese social fabric for thousands of years. Whether he now becomes merchant or , by our standards his career lies along low levels of highly cultivated artifice and artistic mendacity and concealment, illumined by little more than the usually perfect integrity in dollars and cents which seems to him the most profitable policy. Custom, fear, superstition and material gain ride him to the grave; and if he indulges extravagantly in friends it is with the certainty that they will indulge extravagantly in him; for friendship is in his creed as it is in the teachings of Socrates-a cold cooperation. There are Chinese who do not answer to this description; but marvelously few-in X 897. And until one realizes how few, one cannot realize the infinite inertia of that great empire which lies over against Russia like a vast bulk of lead.                 So in verisimilar narratives, too long to trim stably without an appeal to deeper Caucasian sympathies, Caucasian elements must generally be introduced. This is what Mr. Rees has done; but his English girl who marries a Chinaman arouses little more than our curious pity. For, despite his unsurpassed  dignity and his civet-cat cap and his gorgeous winter silks and the bland oil that runs in his veins, it is very Chinese to marry a Chinaman. A few such marriages have happened, and some comparatively high in the social scale; there seems to be nothing that has not happened. And Mr. Ralph has sketched a like conjunction. But we are apt to hold our tears for the things that, considered in their finer abstractions, might have happened to us. Miss Serjeant used to sit in her library, which we are told was ""a nice shady place,"" and read as much as she could find about China. What book she could have read that would not have left the thought of living in China with a Chinese husband forever odious to a woman of ordinary delicacy, is certainly not in the Library of Congress; and it is not likely to have been written by an Englishman. Granted that Chun had embraced soap, and that Nellie Serjeant was motherless, and that her father was a weak rascal, and that Nellie was a fool, still the utter  in                 person of any Chun, and the hopeless occultation of his soul, ought to make his English fiancee homesick in the shade of her own green-gage tree at Bayswater. But it is not as a story that the book is ponderable; as a novel it is crudely put, rambling and swamped with irrelevant matter, and the word "" novel "" might have been omitted from the title-page with greater justice to the author. Mr. Rees's primary intention was to give a picture of ways and means in Northern China; and he saw the clear advantage of the fiction method; but he lacks the art to weld descriptive detail lightly with romantic action.                 By chance, it is the minutiae which make the book worth while; for Mr. Rees is neither a transitory swallow nor a missionary with a bias, which makes his position as an observer comparatively fresh. . He tells of an American missionary who, inferentially, uses tobacco; but this is merely an unguarded Briticism, as British as the frequent  upon food and baths. His acquaintance with the Northern Chinamen-not our fighting Cantonese and Hahkah men, who are the only Celestials, outside of the motley of the legations, with whom we are familiar in America-seems intimate and long-suffering; and he dwells but shortly upon hackneyed points, recounting much that is new and vividly presented, especially the forlornness of life in inland towns like Pa-li Kiao. There is a deal of suggestiveness in the youthful Chun's first impressions of the modern city of Shanghai, where the English, French and Americans rule con.  territories conceded by the Chinese, and where you may pass in an instant from the unutterable filth of the ancient walled city of Shanghai-far filthier than Cantonto the swept pavements and the Sikh policemen and telegraph wires and massive stone buildings of the  Shanghai, whither flock the coolies from all parts of the Kiangsu province, to enjoy the western liberty and justice. Chun attended the Foreign College at Peking; and the statement of how amicably the real facts of history and science lived on in his brain beside the incongruous traditions and superstitions of his native teachings is a most truthful touch, as well as that of his inability to put his new knowledge to any practical purpose. Howsoever faulty Mr. Rees's English is, and howsoever sluggish the movement of the tale, the book is faithfully Chinese in atmosphere and color, and will repay those for whom far Cathay has its fascinating spell.                 The sensuality of Mr. Dawe's 'i Kakemonos "" of the Far East (2) is not of the sallow and gangrene school, but is woven with a raw gusto that is rare, and that is quite distinct from the decayed aestheticism of a second-rate London artistic entourage. The "" Kakemonos"" are nine tales of the kind of life led by a proportion of English bachelors and others in Hong Kong and the treaty ports of Siam, China and Japan; a life made up of whiskey-and.soda, fe. males and horses, and sometimes varied by substituting brandy for the whiskey. All but one of these might have been told in the stuffy smoking-room of an English  on her way down the Formosa Channel, to a gathering of mixed nationality from which perhaps not so many hearers have withdrawn as might nevertheless decline to introduce the teller to the bosoms of their families. As an unwitting exposition of the moral workings of the debauchery formula of the Far East, the book would be of value to some sociological libraries; for its best-drawn character, though apparently without intention, is the hero who relates in the first person all but two of -a creature of ceaseless prurience, with a secretion of cheap cynicism accurately fitted to his own , and capable of pointing a smutty innuendo with a poke of the thumb. Six of the stories centre about women, some born white, others yellow and brown, but all off-color by the time Mr. Dawe has done with them, if not before; and two other tales in which women do not figure seem to fail of forcible crises by lack of the writer s unmitigated enthusiasm for the sort of thing in the other six.                 As a general glimpse of life in that part of the world the book is one-sided, being somewhat overladen with blood and revolvers and being unrelieved by a single character that rises to the level of one s admiration. There are many more clean-minded and decently bred Englishmen about Hong Kong and the treaty ports than one would gather from these pages, and some of them might have been used to advantage in laying on a more truthful background. But the hulking British bully who demolishes a flower-boat at Canton is from life, and is so well represented that one feels with some satisfaction that Canton is well able to dispose of his like. The theme of the marriage of a European to a Japanese woman, where the European is sincere, is so treated that considerable light touches the ostracism that befalls the European, though the reason of that might have been more fully developed. Another similar story, where Hina. San is deserted by a man to whom she has no legal ties, is, notwithstanding the disagreeable subject, carried on a level which is Mr. Dawe's best in this book, and which it would credit him more to maintain.

Philadelphia Blakiston Co For sale by Robert Clarke Co                 After the title-page the first thing that strikes our attention in this little volume is the dedication To Mrs Francis Reeves my beloved wife and only companion in microscopy and then the copyright in her name All the words on these two pages are only half hundred but they speak to                 the heart of an affection and sentiment that commands at once our esteem and admiration for the appreciative author and his beloved wife Dr Reeves is practitioner of more than forty years' experience and our first recollections of him are of his work with the microscope twenty or more years ago This experience as studious general practitioner has enabled him to place in our hands little book that is sufficient to meet the requirements of general practitioners of medicine The importance and actual necessity for microscope are no longer matters of question or of debate For that reason Dr Reeve places the profession under personal obligations in placing within their easy reach hand-book telling of the necessary microscopic outfit and how to use it of works which may be consulted slides and needed materials including stains and how to use them He also gives chapter on bacteriology and others on the examination of neoplasms urinary analysis blood sputum and fecal discharges The language of the author in his descriptions is clear and terse as we might expect from so scientific writer and observer as the author shows himself to be                 THE GRAPHIC HISTORY OF THE FAIR                 It is most natural thing on the part of those who were at the World's Fair to wish for reliable historical sketch of that famous undertaking This purpose the Graphic Company of 358 Dearborn street Chicago has supplied in very creditable manner Their History tells of previous World's Expositions of the of this the greatest of all and beautifully illustrates the several buildings parts and departments The

S1R                  IThe story of a Colorado prospector in an English                 environment. A clever plot, which ought to have led to the making of a stronger book. We wonder if there exists in the world the sort of glorified cowboy herein depicted.                 Sitple a a child, daring als d  , Sith a wonderful profile and speech                  seems a compendium of all slangs known to man-he is more than surprising. It would                 a great deal of profile to atone for such language, which seems more like the lingo invented by British humorists and                  by them on Americans than anything hat could possibly exist in real life.                 The American Husband in Paris. By Anna Blowman Dodd. pp. 15e. Little, Brown & Co.                 A clever and amusing satire on American                 omen of the tuft-hunting, dress-worshiping . The incapacity of such a woman to                  the manly  of fier  Is ith real theme of the book, and the husband s first visit to his wife s favorite  haunts Gives the background.                 The Eternal Quest. By J. A. Stewart. pp. 378. Dodd, Slead & Co. $1.50.                 story of army life, In which the hero, a foung soldier In the Boer war, has to win his ; before he can win his bride.                 The Foundation Rock.

Sweetheart Manette. By Matrice Thempson. pp. 259. J. B. Lippincott Co. $1.25.                 A beautiful Southern girl has five determined lovers at once, four of  being many years her senior. After alternate hope and despair for the various lovers, a duel between two of them and an epidemic of yellow fever, Manette finally makes an unexpected choice. The story is light, easily read at a sitting, and by no means equal to other work of the author.                 Sir Christopher. By Mand Wilder Goodwin. pp.411. Little, Brown & co. $1.50.                 A dramatic story with the popular historical setting, the scene being laid in Maryland in the seventeenth century days of bitter feuds between Catholie and Protestant. The heroine, a widow with the  quota of lovers, is a likable character, while Sir Christopher shows himself a hero indeed in the way he conducts himself under a false accusation of murder. In this, as in her other books, Mrs. Goodwin is careful about her facts and  in her style of writing.                 The Arrows of the Almighty. By Owe,, Jolin,son. pp. 405. Macmillan Co. $1.aO.                 A tragic story of the mysteries of life. Although it covers the period of the Civil War, with the stirring(years immediately preceding and following, instead of taking us to the front It shows us a hero In the Commissarlat. This is a new field and is wonderfully well treated. The story is tinged with sadness throughout but ends in glorious victory, peace and happiness.                 Voysey. By l. 0. Prowse. pp. 404. Maemillall Co. $1.50.                 In the brilliancy of its psychological method this book recalls Henry James, although there is no attempt at either Mr. James or Mrs. Wharton's Ingenuity of situation. The story indeed is the old one of intrigue and  demoralization-old, but never simple. Here it is the difficulty of the man s effort for self-recovery which is emphasized. His story is told with feeling and with a veracity and minuteness of psychological observation which gives the writing unusual distinction, but which will try the patience of the practical reader.

Van Dyke's book is to provide a ""concise, teachable"" history of art "" for classroom use in schools and colleges."" As such the book is admirable; it is even inter- esting to the general reader, as Mr. Van Dyke's criticisms on famous painters and paintings are always clearly and tersely stated and are broadly and liberally conceived. The one hundred and ten reproductions of typical paintings from the days of Egypt to Mr. Chase's latest portraits are far beyond the average text-book repro- duction and are really artistic. The artists em- braced in this compendium represent effect- ively every art cycle from the beginnings of historic art to the latest French Impression- ists, not even forgetting the Boston Art Mu- seum instructors. Yet the book is far more than a mere catalogue of names.-Longmans, Green & Co. Pr.So.                 My Study Fire.                 The second series of Mr. Hamilton W. Mabie's essays contains some representative faces, worth studying with special reference to the places in literature of the men portrayed, Flaubert, Mat- thew Arnold, and Petrarch. Mr. Mabie has not many equals in spiritual insight. Few are they to whom it is given to understand and also to interpret. He is optimist enough to make one more in love with life and with humanity. He intensifies that passion for nature, which may be and is among the purest and sweetest, the most solacing and enduring, that man is capable of and conscious of. He is a guide into new realms of thought and beauty. He helps to a better understanding of the world s great writ- ers. His own vision is clear, and he has the                 gift of being able to place relative values upon things, the gift of proportioning, of properly balancing. The spirit of these essays is sweet and sane, reverent and uplifting. Mr. Mabie advocates ""the gospel of a full and rich life, fed from all the divine sources of truth, beauty, and power,"" and believes in duties nobly met and work thoroughly done.-Dodd, Mead & Co. $1.50.                 In Cairo and Jerusalem.                 Miss Mary Thorn Carpenter in her ""Eastern Note-Book"" has written a delightful and emi- nently readable guidebook to Cairo and Jerusa- lem. Avoiding the perpetual temptation of fine  which besets all writers of travels, she still manages to convey the color and glow of ""the gorgeous East."" The most interesting chap- ters are those which describe {' A Day with the Copts"" and ""In a Coptic Cathedral ;"" here, where Miss Carpenter deals with unfamiliar facts, she shows excellent qualities of observa- tion and discrimination. In no accessible book can be found such interesting details about ""the descendants of the faint pictures of fair saints, gilded on the missals of their church,"" as Miss Carpenter gives. The book is well il- lustrated.-A. D. F. Randolph & Co. $1.50.                 Studies in Modern Music.                 The theory of musical criticism apart from the uncritical standard of "" likes and dislikes "" has always been a very abstruse subject to the lay mind. Mr. W. H. Hadow in this volume goes as far to elucidate this science for those not versed in musical theory as any writer has done, and yet there are pages after pages in his book which are quite unintelligible to the music lover whose education has stopped short of ""thorough base"" and ""counterpoint."" Apart from Mr. Hadow's theory he gives three very interesting studies of modern musicians. The essay on Chopin is excellent, but covering well- known ground is less attractive to the general reader than the sketches of Dvorak and Brahms, whom Mr. Hadow considers to be the direct successor of Bach and Beethoven in scope and its the dignified ideals of his art.-Macmillan & Co. $2.25.                 The Heresy of Cain.                 This is a series of twenty-one admirable ad- dresses about practical duties, and especially the bearing of Christianity on the many social problems of our busy modern life, by George Hodges, dean of the Episcopal Theological School, Cambridge. Matters of daily conduct in our relations with others, the relief of pov- erty, sanitation, and civic duties, are some of the topics discussed vigorously and thought- fully. High praise is due to the clearness, terseness, and force of the author s language. Much of the book may be heartily commended for lay use in churches temporarily without a pastor as well as for private reading; not all of the statements Will please the theologians.- T. Whittaker. sx.oo.                 Master and Men.                 The first seven beatitudes are here treated, by William Burnet Wright, in an original and inter- esting manner. Certain startling contrasts be- tween the precepts of the Master and the prac- tice of his nominally Christian followers are first presented. The author then takes up the beati-                 tudes and gives to each a chapter of discussion and a chapter of illustration by way of biogra- phy of some man selected to exemplify the quality. These heroes are Moses and St. Paul, Socrates, King Alfred, George Fox, General Gordon, and George MacDonald. The sketches are exceedingly eulogistic, and there is reason for wonder at the distribution of the various qualities which Christ pronounced blessed. Re- garded as an attempt to reconcile the contrasts set forth at the beginning, the book is disappoint- ing, yet the many striking and occasionally elo- quent passages and the interest of its sketches of character render it entertaining and suggestive. -Houghton, Mifflin & Co. $x.25.

18,"                                                                                                 THE BOOK OF THE MONTH                 TIlE ROYAL ROAD TO AFFABILITY                 BY LAWRENCE GILMAN                 IT iS said by the publisher of the famous Book of Etiquette that nearly half a million people have paid $3.50 each for that ineffable Baedeker of manners-which, if neither the pub- lishers' veracity nor our arithmetic is impeachable, means that almost two million dollars have been expended by those who wish to learn the correct thing to do when one s parrot becomes Rabelaisian while the pastor is calling, or what to say to Llewellyn when he draws the attention of the luncheon party to the obvious fact that Uncle Joshua's toupee has become displaced. Doubt-                 less the publishers are right when they tell us that this is an indication of the truth that the Guide is ""the recognized au- thority on the subject of Etiquette among people of culture, re- , and good breeding everywhere."" No doubt it is; and we linger a moment, in passing, upon the mental picture of (let us say) Mrs. Wharton and Mrs. Schuyler Van Rensselaer and President Lowell poring over those sublime chapters while they confront the agitating social problems incident to ""the coming wedding, dinner, dance"", seeking that ""ease, poise, con- fidence in oneself "" which is promised as the reward of a diligent study of the Guide.                 It is an inspiring thought-the thought of one out of every two hundred persons among the 100,000,000 of our population deep in those pages, seeking light from the only authentic source of illumination upon those problems of social deportment which will some day be mastered by us all as the Guide continues its peaceful -penetration of the home, the office, and the lodge. A nation one hundred per cent refined, one hundred per cent well bred, one hundred per cent cultured: the vision is breath- taking.                 It is far from being an inaccessible ideal. We can, without much straining of the spiritual eyesight, discern an America universally and impeccably refined. Americans have two transcendent passions: the passion for organization, and the passion for social emulation. It is as natural for citizens of These States to form themselves into Junior Orders of American Mechanics, Pythian Sisters, Degrees of Pocahontas, Mystic Shriners, and Improved Orders of Red Men, as it is for English- men, with their hankering after privacy and their incurable individualism, to be averse from such group manifestations. Now, imagine these American fraternities, sisterhoods, and as-  of one kind and another-from the Improved Order of Red Men to the Colonial Dames-adopting as a common object the acquirement of Complete Refinement. Can you conceive of their being thwarted? If you can, you have failed to note the appalling certainty and swiftness with which the American achieves conformity. For, to those things which, according to the sayings of Bhartrihari, ""are insatiable of one another""- ""ocean, of rivers; death, of mortals; fire, of fuel; woman, of man"" -should be added this other: ""Americans, of conformity."" That dread of saliency which restrains an American from wearing a straw hat on a warm October day is the same phobia which makes it impossible for him to conceive that there is more than one course of action open to the Well Bred Man when the waiter anoints his shirtfront with sauce piquante.                 But the Baedeker of Manners concerns itself, after all, chiefly with conduct; What to Say is indicated only when saying is almost equivalent to doing-as when introducing one s son by a second marriage to one s divorced wife. There has been, up to the present time, an uncultivated territory in the campaign for refinement. Our mentors have forgotten that we must con- verse. But now we need no longer remain in ignorance of the art of successful conversation. Have you ever attended a dinner party ""where there have been awkward gaps in the conversa- tion""? Have you ever spent a half-hour with a debutante, a Prime Minister, a Prohibitionist, or a man whose hobby was the early history of the Baptist Church, and been ""at your wits' end to know what conversational leads to advance""? Would you                 learn how to converse easily, gracefully, interestingly, reward- ingly-in a word, successfully? Then make haste to visit your bookseller and provide yourself with What To Talk About: The Clever Question as an Aid to Social, Professional, and Business Advancement, by Imogene B. Wolcott.' Therein you will learn what to talk about to accountants, actresses, babies, brides, clergymen, debutantes, decorators (interior), detectives, elderly people, judges, lumbermen, matrons (society), newspaper men, nurses, ""parents of a baby"", ""parents of a family"", private secretaries, druggists, grocers, scouts (boy and girl), - phers, trolley officials, welfare officials-and a host of others. Moreover, you will learn what to talk about to those whose hobby is astrology, bees, bowling, cats, eugenics, fancy work, flying, jiu jitsu, metal work, spiritualism, stamps, weaving, ice hockey, yachting. Furthermore, you will be instructed in the art of conversing with ""those who have lived in or traveled to"" Algiers, Atlantic City, Deauville, Glacier National Park, the Holy Land, Indianapolis, Newport, Niagara Falls, Palm Beach, Russia, St. Louis, Wales, and the Vacation Spots of New England.                 The method is simple. Let us say that you wish-that you are obliged-to talk to a ""matron (society)"". What shall you talk to her about? Nothing could be simpler. You have your copy of What to Talk About (price: $1.90) with you in the taxi. You can read it without much difficulty by the street lights. The introduction tells you how to proceed: ""Turn to page 70 and look at the questions listed under the heading: What to Tal7c About to Matrons (Society)."" You turn; you look. There is a brief introductory paragraph, designed to make it easy for you to recognize the distinction between a ""Matron"" and a ""Society Matron"": ""An Englishman describes the society matron in this manner: 'Incredibly lovely and well-dressed, not only devoted passionately to pleasure and the arts, but in the vanguard of a thousand movements. She is the arbiter of national elegancies, and, Heaven knows, she may be the guardian of national des- tinies.""' Now that you are prepared to recognize her, here are several of the things you would do well to say to her:-                 ' G. P. Putnam's Sons, New York and London.                 Do you think it was any easier to entertain successfully in the days before prohibition than it is now?                 * * *                 Haven't you found it true that nine times out of ten, the man of the family will wait until dinner is announced before going upstairs to wash his hands?                 You will probably not need to remember the second Clever Question; the first will suffice, until it is time for the Society Ma- tron to turn brightly to the Undertaker on her other side (were not ladies instructed, in the old days, to ""turn with the roast""?). Well, the Matron has turned, and, having learned from her copy of The Clever Question what to talk about to Undertakers, is busy with interrogations about the recent flurry in the tombstone market and the recreations of gravediggers. It is now your part to deal with your neighbor on your left.                 But here, it may be, you perceive a difficulty, just as we did. Suppose you don't know (we are assuming that you yourself, for the moment, are a Society Matron)-suppose you don't know whether the neighbor on your other side is a Detective, a Dentist, a Meat Man, or a Trolley Official? Clever Questions has foreseen this difficulty. But first you are warned: ""Don't begin a con- versation with a clever remark. In fact, it is dangerous to be clever at all unless you are among well-tried friends.                 Don't pretend to know more than you do, or to like what you don't. Express your own mind honestly. . . . Personal remarks are in good taste if they are pleasant. If you admire a woman s string of beads, or think that she is a good influence in the Ladies' Aid, tell her so.""                 But is your neighbor a Dentist or a Meat Man? You are wondering. Your course of action is plainly marked out: ""If you don't know a man s line, ask him point-blank. If you don't know anything at all about his business, tell him so, and risk being thought an ignoramus. This is better than appearing uninterested. If you ask him, he will gladly explain the na- ture of his work and its outstanding problems."" You proceed according to rule:                 ""I beg your pardon, but what is your line?"" ""I am a Detective, madam.""                 Indeed! How very interesting!""                 You have your Clever Questions on your lap. Feigning to have dropped a pea, you stoop to find it. The detective stoops too. While he is searching for the pea, you turn swiftly, and with the sureness bred of long practice, to page 42, What to Talk About to Detectives. Here you are: ""What are some of the various methods of procedure in finding a criminal?"" As the detective abandons the pea and comes up for air and sociability, you apply your Conversation Opener (it is No. 3 on the list).                 But suppose he has answered: ""I am a Dentist."" You proceed as before, with the following as your indicated Conversation Opener:                 What is the most important tooth in one s mouth?                 If this fails to produce results, you may try the following: Should a dentist confine his efforts to care of the teeth?                 He will probably answer, Yes; in which case, you may come back with an eloquent recommendation of the delights of basket- weaving or dermatology as side-lines.                 The scope of this assemblage of Clever Questions is extraordi- nary. There are 286 pages of them, of which we take leave to exhibit a few more, chosen at random:                 For a Trolley Official:                 What do you  of the one-man car? For a Druggist:                 What proportion of your business is selling drugs?                 [If your -neighbour should appear to resent this question for any reason, pass quickly to the next:                 What would you do if a man came into your store to purchase some bi- chloride-of-mercury tablets?]                 For an Electrical Supply Dealer:                 Why does an electric iron cost so much more to run than an electric fan? For an Elderly Person:                 Does fear of death become stronger or less strong as one grows older? [If this seems tactless, try the following: What is the secret of your contentment?]                 For the Parents of a Baby. This is important, so we shall exhibit the author s prelude, since it establishes the desirable                 mood in the interrogator: ""A baby will make love stronger, days shorter, nights longer, bank roll smaller, home happier, clothes shabbier, the past forgotten, and the future worth living for"". This may be committed to memory, and used as an introductory quotation. Here are the Clever Questions for the Parents. As they depend on the baby s age, it is highly important to know the facts in the case, and not to mix them up.                 Has he smiled yet? (1 month)                 Can he hold up his head? (4 months) Can he sit alone? (6 months)                 Can he sing and dance? (19 months) Can he make sentences? (25 months)                 But you will, of course, need to converse on other occasions than at dinners and luncheons. Instead of being obliged to talk to a Parent, you may need to talk to Baby himself. Bear in mind this preliminary warning: ""In meeting a baby, one should behave as much as possible like a baby oneself. . . . Abstain from cooing, grimacing, tickling, and the like, and model your deportment on the dignified but friendly reticence that one baby evinces in meeting another."" But what to say? The difficulty is imaginary. If the baby is under three years old, seat him on your foot, and recite to him the immortal trotting rhymes that we all know by heart, beginning-                 Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake, Baker's man!                 If he is over three years old, hold him firmly by his little neck- band while you recite to him a poem by Mr. Vachel Lindsay, which you wir find quoted in full in Clever Questions. It seems a drastic prescription, but it is not our part to reason why.                 You are aided in this priceless book, as we have intimated, by other guides than classification by occupations. There are classifications by Hobbies and by Geographical Residence. For example, you have learned, by delicately heedful probing or by blunt interrogation, that the patient is a Meat Man hailing from Palm Beach whose hobby is Butterflies. Referring in order to pages 94, 125, 236, you proceed confidently as follows, your questions falling into this order as easily (in Mr. Kipling's words) ""as one thing leads to another"":                 Is frozen meat perfectly wholesome?                 * * *                 Do butterflies have a home life as do birds, bees, and ants?                 * * *                 How long does the season last in Florida?                 You can see that the method is capable of infinite extension. Using Clever Questions as a model, you can easily draw up your own formulas to suit almost any conceivable situation; so that, in case you should ever find yourself confronting an Osteopath from Niagara Falls whose hobby is Rabbits, you will know pre- cisely what to say. . . . Already we can hear you rehearsing the formula to yourself:                 Do you agree that Niagara-or the Thunder of Waters, as the Iroquois Indians named it-is one of the world s most impressive spectacles?                 * * *                 Are rabbits hard or easy to raise?                 * * *                 Of course I don't mean ""from the rabbit s point of view""! I mean- The possibilities, you perceive, are infinite.                 LAWRENCE GILMAN.

New York, The Macmillan Oompany, 1906  Price Pl.60.                 Were one asked to recommend the book of the season of  practical importance for ministerial candidates to purchase and master by painstaking study, no mistake would be made in naming this remarkably fresh and stimulating treatise on homiletics as that book. It is not an unusual experience for young men starting out in their ministry, to discover themselves less adequately equipped with insight and method as to the preparation and delivery of sermons, than as to any other department of their professional duties. In the way of providing                 the wider information and surer guidance needed to make up for such a realized lack, it is questionable whether there is in the English language any work of equal or corresponding importance and , as compared with that which Professor Brastow has here given to the public. An office of inestimable value to the churches of the land could be performed by some one financially able and generously disposed, were he to place a copy of this book into the hands of every theological student and preacher of the Gospel in the country. Is it too much to hope that this suggestion may induce some one, say a prosperous Elder, to present with his compliments, a copy to every young man about to be graduated from the several theological institutions of our Reformed Church?                 : The volume before us is not a repetition of the customary trifles or commonplaces which too generally have received almost sole attention in books and lectures on this subject. Its author realizes the deeper value attaching, not only to a thorough acquaintance with the methods and examples of those who are recognized masters of pulpit effort and power, but, even more so, to a clear apprehension of the environing spirit and tendencies of thought by which such preachers are affected, and their methods inspired and directed. Hence he undertakes the analysis and  of the influences which for a century or two have been active in revolutionizing preaching, summarizes the qualities that are prominent in it, distinctive of it, common to it, and from a large and instructive field, gathers most suggestive and helpful concrete illustrations. In bis studies and expositions, one discovers his familiarity with the German and British scholars who have cultivated the same field before him. Bothe and Christlieb and Ker and other authorities are quoted, but what is especially impressive throughout his chapters is the comprehensive grasp, the keen analysis, and the discriminating skill with which he handles the subject-matter of his treatise.                 After devoting a hundred and forty pages to what may be                 called a history and philosophy of preaching during the eight.  and nineteenth centuries, he takes up for consideration modern preaching as represented by different nationalities and religious communions. The German pulpit, the Anglican pulpit, the Free Church pulpit of England, the Scottish preaching, and the preaching of the United States, are examined in order in the remaining three hundred pages. The sermons of their leading pulpit exponents are instanced and analyzed, their dominant qualities pointed out, their significance interpreted in the light of the prevailing conditions and characteristics of the times, and their meaning for the religious life of to-day suggested and enforced. Under this method one comes to see, for instance, the significance of such men as Tholuck, Mtiller, Ullmann, and Rothe, in Germany; Newman, Robertson, Mozley, Dale, and Martineau, in England; Bushnell, Ohanning, Finney, Beecher, and Brooks, in America, with new appreciation and in clearer light. They are not merely individual makers of sermons, but organic parts of the activities and movements of current intellectual and religious life, at once the product and the molders of the thought. life of their generation. If there is any other book in our literature that along these lines has equal homiletical inspiration and assistance to offer. one should be thankful to have his attention                 called to it.

Censure Homer for his occasional nodding, and you thereby enhance the renown of Virgil-or imagine you do. In the closing years of the last century William Vaughn Moody and those other gifted ones with whom he associated at Cambridge decided among themselves that Tennyson lacked the spirit of true poetry; and condemnation of a poet of Tennyson's fame must carry with it a certain sense, innocent and harmless enough, to be sure, of elation and superiority in the censor. At a recent Chicago banquet of poets, the guest of honor, Mr. William Butler Yeats, took occasion to pay tribute to a brother poet, Mr. Nich- olas Vachel Lindsay, in this wise: *' I address Mr. Lindsay because I have read his 'General Booth Enters Heaven,' and in it I recognize the work of a brother poet. Before there can be great poetry in any country the poets must be humble and sim- ple. The reason many of us have revolted against Tennyson is that he is too ornate. Paul Verlaine, whom I saw in my youth, told me that he could not translate Tennyson because lie was too 'English'; when he should have been bowed down with grief he stopped for reminiscence. Mr. Lindsay speaks the simple language of the humble people. He is a truth.speaker."" Why make invidious comparisons when it is sufficient to point out differences? There are diversities of poetic gifts, but the same spirit.                 ANTIPODEAN LIBRARY ACTIVITIES acquire for us a certain peculiar interest from their very remote- ness in geographical location. In the latest number that has reached us of that enterprising trilingual                 periodical, ""The Library Miscellany,"" of Baroda, we find in the section devoted to India (and printed in English) the following: ""At the suggestion of MIr. Govindbhai H. Desai, Subah of Kadi Division, the Kadi Agriculturists' Association have organized a travelling exhibition of agricultural implements. The Library Department has cooperated by sending an assistant who delivers lectures on library topics and social and moral questions. An assistant from the Visual Instruction Branch, with a ' Kok' cinema, sets of stereoscopes and stereographs, is also de- puted."" Do we see here the Oriental adoption of an American idea? Another item may for more reasons than one prove interesting. ""Mrs. Billious [one almost wishes the compositor had inverted the u], the widow of Mr. Billious, a Jew merchant of Howrah, has declared her intention of making over to the Howrah Municipality her palatial residence with about 150 bighas of beautifully laid out garden situated in the heart of the town, to be utilized as a public library. The deed of gift will take effect after her death. The property is worth five lakhs of rupees."" And will the institution thus generously provided for be known as the Billious Public Library?                 THE DEATH OF AN ACCOMPLISHED GREEK SCHOLAR, such as Rufus B. Richardson showed himself to be, is occasion for peculiar regret in these days of lessening regard for such scholarship. Theological studies seem tc have claimed his devo- tion in earlier life, his academic course at Yale hav- ing been followed by three years at the Yale Divinity School and further studies of the same nature at the University of Berlin. But in 1880, at the sufficiently mature age of thirty-five, he accepted the chair of Greek at Indiana University, whence he was called to a like professorship at Dartmouth two years later. There he remained until 1893, when he was appointed Director of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, a post that lie held for ten years. In his later retirement at Woodstock, Conn., he occupied himself chiefly with writing and study. He was the author of many peri.  contributions on archeological and classical subjects, and also of the books, ""Vacation Days in Greece,"" ""Greece through the Stereoscope,"" and ""History of Greek Sculpture."" AEschines's ""Ora- tion against Ctesiphon"" was edited by him while he was at Dartmouth. He was born at Westford, Mlass., April 18, 1845, and died at Clifton Springs, N. Y., March 10, of this year.                 LOCAL TALENT IN THE LIBRARY iS commonly preferred to imported. It is pleasant to deal with an assistant whom one has known for years; it is sometimes embarrassing to go with one s questions and complaints to an entire stranger behind the delivery desk or in the reference room. Moreover, tax-payers like to see their money circulate among their own people, and not drained off by outsiders. Something may be read between the lines, as well as in the lines, of the announcement of the Cali-                 fornia Board of Library Examiners, printed in the current issue of ""News Notes of California Libra- ries,"" to the effect that ""for the present no - nations will be given outside the State, for many reasons: (1) Experience has shown that only per- sons who bave lived in the State and have done library work in a way to gain personal knowledge of California conditions really understand the county free library plan for California. The aim of the examination is to see how thorough the applicant s knowledge is of the conditions under which the county free library work must be carried on, and of the problems to be met in the work as it is actually being done in this State. A real and sympathetic understanding of the work in California is thus absolutely necessary. (2) The members of the Board feel that the oral examination is very impor- tant. They feel that they cannot fairly judge of an applicant s qualifications without meeting him in this way.""                 A PRoPosED GIPr TO TiHE HARVARD LIBRARY                 comprises nearly three thousand volumes of Mormon literature collected by a Salt Lake City business man and now offered for sale, as a whole, at two dollars and fifty cents a volume. Secretary Roger Pierce, of the Harvard Alumni Association, is urging the Utah graduates of the university to fur- nish the money necessary to secure this collection, and to let it find shelter in the splendid library building now rising on the site of Gore Hall. That Mormonism possesses so large a body of literature as twenty-eight hundred volumes (the number given in the current report) will be news to many. The claim that this is the best collection of the sort in the West is not likely to be contested. Although the Mormon Church wishes to buy five hundred volumes of the collection to complete its own library, the owner prefers to sell the whole lot at once.

general absence of sensationalism the quietness of her beauty make firmer impression upon the mind than her occasional violent effects Even though the vivid colors the flashing                 and gorgeous flowers ihe ii ure skies and dazzling of the tropics fascinate the eye by their brilliancy is great mass of quiet color which keeps the whole in harmony And after all though we speak of the blue sea the green grass etc none of he colors in Nature are simple crude tones such as the pigments in our ts Kxamine scarlet geranium or any other intensely flower and you will tind it to be composed of number of quite sober shades of red some delicate grays and only moderate amount of pure vermilion Then                 the -blue sky or sea is still more varied in color multitude of delicate gradations of purples greens and grays unite to produce what we call blue At the times when Nature seems to throw prudence to the winds and launch forth recklessly as in the glory of some gorgeous sunset if we look carefully we shall see that her richest effects are mainly by subtle contrasts of color Hide the glowing rosy or golden blaze in the sky with the hand and immediately the distant hill or cloud which seemed by contrast to be pure purple resolves into an almost neutral gray Look at butterfly s wing and we are compelled to admire the maris reserve of Nature's designer Some butterflies such as the are remarkable for possessing lustrous metallic spots on the win and the way in which these rarer features are made precious by subtle gradations and contrasts is revelation in design It seems as if an intelligent mind were at work The highest art in music painting architecture and the rest is one with nature in this it avoids sensationalism though it is able to focus its whole intensity of color or interest with extreme force when required Good art never shrinks It never wastes its superlatives nor brings out its ultimate resources its reserve forces unless absolutely necessary One of the loveliest dreams of color and mystery of flashing gold and jewels is St Mark's Duomo Venice Who that has seen this priceless heirloom from the remote Middle Ages can ever forget the quiet rich dignity of the coloring of the facade with its immense mosaics and shafts of precious marbles And the interior somber yet not gloomy opulent with ruby and pearl and gold every tone placed as lovingly as Nature arranges the colors of the butterfly And amid all the richness and low there is nothing startling nothing abrupt or extravagant In great pictures we find the same quality You feel that there is great force in reserve that all the goods are not in the window to use homely illustration Through the ages we find the decadence of art almost invariably shown by an increase in sensational ostentation The history of the Gothic style of architecture the early purity of which degenerated into voluptuous over-ornate flamboyant style is good example of what appears to be an universal tendency                 In our own day the passion tor personal advertisement has reached such pitch that sensationalism in art is found everywhere All who have visited Genoa will remember the remarkable sculptures in the Campo Santo concrete examples of modern want of reserve The carvings on the tombs are marvelously skillful tours tie force and the sculptors have strained all their resources in their efforts to make the spectator gasp with astonishment at their dexterity and audacity To quote from an overenthusiastic article just published No description could ever render tithe of justice to the magnificence of the statues which abound The statues are photographs in marble lifesize and life-like and so intensely realistic that it would scarcely surprise one if they turned round and commenced to speak Every detail is considered down to the pattern of                 the lace upon woman shawl the style ot man s hat and the folds of his overcoat as it rests over his arm How different from the broad and stately method of the Greeks and of the great sculptors of the Fifteenth and Sixteenth centuries who subordinated all superfluous detail to the main impression Most people feed their artistic perceptions upon the pictures in the illustrated periodicals and the advertisements in the streets for these are always with us and constantly exert their hypnotic power while visit to fine-art gallery is rare event As the ephemeral art of the journals is so largely sensational the public has become used to such work and will inevitably demand it in more permanent creations We must get back to Nature's methods and strive to encourage the art which will not cater to the appetite for sensationalism but which will into our affection by its quiet power seriousness and genuine inspiration Great art has the same foundation as has strong character among men and women it is manifestation of the soul and its influence is similar how much great work has been done by the steady calm persistence of firm devoted souls who moved without haste without rest As we purify our lives and strengthen our natures we shall prepare the wav for and become to

Mr. Richard Hovey has translated four of the Plays of Maurice Maeterlinck ($1.25] and Messrs. Stone & Kimball have published them in what they term The Green Tree Library, which has a quaint and handsome binding. Maeterllnek deals largely in commonplaces and these plays often are tedious. But, as Mr. Hovey points out in the preface, they are surcharged, as it were, with an at. mosphere of gloom and terror. It in a sign                 or genius to create tuis impression  so slight a use of uncommon materials and methods. We do not like the volume and do not recommend it. It is morbid, unwholesome, grotesque and now and then Indecent. But it is undeniably the work of a unique, although an unhealthy, genius.                 The Heroes of the Nations Series continues to appear and the twelfth volume is Prince Henry, the Navigator [G. P. Putnam's Sons. $1.50], by C. R. Beazly. Prince Henry was the hero of Portugal and of modern discovery. His career covered the years from 1394 to 1460, and Mr. Beazley has written a weli-studied and proportioned account of his adventurous and use. ful life together with a clear and instructive summary of geographical knowledge up to Prince 1enry s day. The maps in the:volume form one of its best and most striking features. They are copies of old and rare                 maps which are ou the utmost S  to the historical or geographical student and several of them are believed to be repro. duced here for the frst time In any English volume.

Perry has translated, by authority, Prof. Friedrich Paulsen's work, The German Universities, their Character and Historical Developmdent (& & Co. $2.00], and Prof. N. M. Butler has supplied an Introduction. The character of Professor Patulsen's book is indicated well by the title. It is brief and a little in the nature of a summary, yet sufficiently full to afford all needed Information and of a high order.of merit. Professor Butler's introduction discusses the relation of the German university to American higher educational problems. The work of course is primarily for educators but it has in It considerable material of general Interest.                 The Anthropological Series is another series added to the long list. Its first volume, ThePygmies[D.Appleton&Co. $1.76] by the late Prof. A. de Quatrefages, translated by Frederick Starr, is a promising beginning. The volume Is one which the learned and famous author left behind him. Not much Is known about the small black races, but whatever has been discovered appears to have been acquired by the author and embodied In these pages. It is historical, descriptive and scientific all in one, is full of important facts and a chapter is devoted to their religious beliefs. Their language Is explained, their customs are described, and, In a word, the book Is a treasury of facts concerning them.-Dr. William Pepper's book, Higher Medical Education (J. B. Lippincott Co. $1.00], contains two addresses before the medical department of the University of Pennsylvania on Oct. 1, 1877, and Oct. 2, 1893, respectively. It Il of interest and importance not only for Its actual statements,; figures, etc., but also because It so clearly explains the large progress In medical knowledge and practice which has been made during the sixteen years. ,                 The Schoolmaster in Comedy and. Satire (American Book Co. $1.40] is a companion work to The Schoolmaster In Literature. It contains selections from , Ascham, Shakespeare, Fdnelon, Swift, Pope, Miss Edgeworth, Scribe, N. P. Willis, Dickens, etc., and is meant for teachers and others, especially such as read together In circles or clubs. It has been prepared with care and is likely to give satisfaction in use. It is printed In clear and handsome type.-Messrs. Henry  & to. have brought out a compact and tasteful edition of John Lyly's Endymion, the Man in the Mooni (85 cents], edited with introduction and notes by G. P. Baker. There is a biographical and critical sketch of Lyly which has been elaborated in a most careful and scholarly manner, and the book is a good example of thorough and intelligent work in its line,                 Dr. C. E. Stevens's Sources of the Constitution of the United States Considered in Belation to Colonial and English History (Macmillan & Co. $2.00] has reached its second edition and appears revised and enlarged. Even more than at first it deserves high praise and confidence. Its analysis of our institutions, in the class under view, and its study of their development are acute.and                 thorough. An interesting fact of a minor, yet important, character is its refutation of some of the late Douglas Campbell's mistaken claims of the supremacy of Dutch  over the early settlers of this country.-Dr. F. S. Billings is the author of Iow Shall the Rich Escape? [$2.00] which the Arena Company has published "" for the author."" He discusses social and religious topics and seems to be at war about equally with common sense, good morals and Christianity and his book Is a strange medley. Of course there are some true and  utterances in it, hut on the whole It is the production of an unbalanced judgment. -The SaUlor's Magazine and Seamen's Friend [American Seamen's Friend Society. $1.50] for 1804 makes a good appearance. It is a magazine of much interest in its way and edited well. It is of general  as well as of special value to seafaring men.

Miss Curtis is introduced to us as an) ir-  and irritating spinster of fortune, fond of experimenting on people; once  proposed to  poor children to her house and leave things about to see if they  steal, a scheme prevented by Oliva's  sending her a cream cake stuffed with red pepper, having a grievance of his own to satisfy.

Bibliographies of German geographical literature and map products are of especial value to geographers, because Germany has still so much to teach the rest of the world as to the content of geography and the methods of using geographical data in books and maps. For these reasons the third volume of this report on German geographical literature in r1o2-x9O3 will be as heartily  as the earlier volumes. The contents are so classified that every literary and cartographic reference is easily found. Under nearly all the titles are a few lines of descriptive or critical matter.

By Hiram Cor- son, LL.D. New York: Macmillan & Co.                 Every book written by Professor Hiram Cor- son is sure to meet with a hearty reception from those who are interested in English literature. He is undoubtedly one of the leading critics now living; his works on Browning and Shake- speare have made him known in all parts of England and America. Of late years he seems to have turned his special attention to. the dis- cussion of general phases of educational work.                 His ""Aims of Literary Study,"" now in its fourth                 edition, struck the keynote of the movement that tends to the more sympathetic study of the masterpieces of English literature in our colleges. The little volume just published, en- titled ""The Voice and Spiritual Education,"" is an expansion of some of the ideas suggested in the previous book. With all the power that comes from a life-long study of the best litera- ture and a long experience of teaching, Profes- sor Corson speaks to the educators of this country in no uncertain tones. He has a face-  of expression that reminds one of Lowell; and in this book there are many bril- liant statements that might be quoted, but which must be omitted in this brief review.                 Spiritual education is necessary for the high- est vocal culture. Without this ability to re- spond to and assimilate the informing life of any product of literary genius, mere vocal train- ing avails little or nothing. This education is the very opposite of what generally passes for education: ""He would be the ideal teacher who could induce a maximum amount of edu- cation on the basis of a minimum amount of requirement."" Knowledge may be developed at the expense of the interior divinity. Spir- itual education must be begun early. ""1 The child must feel before it can know."" The child must be considered as an impressionable being, and home-life must minister to his spiritual nature. Some very suggestive remarks are made on the reading of children. "" Upon the closed bud of reason, while it is not yet ready to be unfolded, must be brought to bear the genial warmth of sensibility, sympathy, and enthusi- asm."" In the colleges and universities there must be the same appeal to man s higher life; all acquisition of knowledge must be made sub- ordinate to the one great aim of quickening life. "" To fit the soul to be spoken to by the eternal word, is the true, the ultimate object of spiritual education.""                 With this spiritual training received in the home and college, with the power to see the hidden meanings of the author, the man or woman is prepared to  vocal culture. The author is very severe in his denunciation of modern ""elocutionary spouting ""-"" The voice instead of being the organ of the soul is the betrayer of soullessness."" He gives several amusing incidents of extreme elocution of the present day. There is nothing in the average elocutionist that is ""1 clamorous for expression, not even a very still small voice urging him to express something."" The true vocal training can only be begun by one who is '"" impelled to                 cultivate vocal power because of his desire to express what he has sympathetically and lov. ingly assimilated, of a work of genius."" With this purpose in view, ""it is possible for the heaviest, clumsiest voice to be trained to the light touch."" The student of vocal culture must by long years of study and practice get the mas- tery of articulation, wide range of pitch, all degrees of force, every variety of inflection, accelerated and retarded utterance, many qual- ities of voice, etc. The author gives an inter- esting practical exercise in the "" light touch "" by marking a long passage from the Book of Daniel.                 The writer of this review heard Professor Corson say that twenty years of diligent prac- tice were required to give him the control over his voice that he now has. No one who has heard him read the plays of Shakespeare can fail to see how much there is in his contention for the highest kind of vocal culture. To hear him read is to remove all doubts as to his thorough knowledge of the subject which he treats in this book. The book will doubtless be widely read, and will have a wide influence in calling attention to the evils of so-called elo- cution and the need for a more rational culture of the human voice. "" The sweetest music is not in the oratorio, but in the human voice when it speaks from its instant life tones of tender-                 ness, truth, or courage.""

FoR many persons, nothing has a greater attraction than the various forms of intercollegiate contests. In the fall term, foot-ball is in vogue; during the winter, there are track athletics; and the college year is closed with base-ball and rowing. Among the conflicts, the great debates be- tween rival colleges occupy a unique position; for they are virtually the only contests in  are exhibited to the public not physical power and endurance, but intellectual skill and grasp.                 As debating fits well into the original purpose of college life, it is not surprising that it has so long occupied a place there. Between 1840 and 1860 it held a position of preeminence; receiving a greater share of attention than any other feature of undergraduate activity. Indeed nearly every student took some part in it.                 Investigation shows that not a few of our great men acquired in this way their incentive to effort, and their earliest training for later achievements. Among the records of the debating societies of Williams College are found many  of the debates between the late Presi- dent Garfield and Ex-Senator Ingalls. The occasions, when these two were pitted against each other,-occasions when even standing-room was at a premium,-are well remembered. It is interesting to note how plainly the characteristics of these distinguished men were already vis- ible in this college work. A spectator at one of their battles describes Garfield as a 'slow debater,"" but cool, reliable, showing excellent judg- ment, and descending with unerring accuracy and force on his oppo- nent s weak- points; while Ingalls was quick, brilliant, sarcastic, and lightning-like in thought and expression.                 In the early sixties, debating began gradually to decline in interest. This may have been due to a general depression in educational work; for nearly every institution suffered a diminution in numbers and, con- sequently, a reduction of activity in all departments. About fifteen years ago, when matters collegiate were reviving, the great athletic con- tests came into being; absorbing the attention of the students. Debat- ing, however, continued dormant.                 It is only within the last few years that the great intercollegiate                 debating leagues have been formed; giving to this work the stimulus of public notice. But, once revived, probably nothing in the world of education has made more rapid progress. At present there are no less than a score of collegiate debating leagues in all parts of the country. Yale, Harvard, and Princeton have annual contests; the University of Pennsylvania debates with Cornell; Williams, with Dartmouth; and Columbia, looking to the West, has found an opponent in the University of Chicago. The most novel arrangement, however, is that of North- western University and the Universities of Michigan, Chicago, and Minnesota. These, about a year ago, formed the Central Debating League,-the most comprehensive union of the kind yet produced. The four universities dispute in groups of two each; and, later, the winners of these two contests meet for a final battle. Additional leagues are continually being formed. Not many months ago Dartmouth started a new one with Brown; indeed, nearly every centre of learning takes part, at least once a year, in some affair of this sort.                 This activity permeates the atmosphere of each college; and posi- tions on the team of debaters for a great intercollegiate struggle are ob- tained only after a most rigorous and exhaustive competition. There can be no doubt as to the desirability of this competitive work. It produces good debaters; and a good debater must be an apt compiler of authorities and statistics, an expert thinker, and able to select the vital points on which the fate of an argument depends. Withal he must be a speaker of sufficient ability to put his whole spirit into the point he wishes to make, and thus arouse the interest and sympathy of his audience.                 Usually the intercollegiate debating teams consist of three men, with an alternate or substitute. In most cases, one of these has the supervision of the preparation for the debate; though, necessarily, each must have a large degree of freedom in his individual work.                 There aTe various methods of preparing and selecting these men. At Cornell they are chosen, ordinarily, from the seven debating soci- eties, where they have the best opportunity for drill. Largely through excellent preparation, Cornell has defeated the University of Pennsyl- vania for two successive years. Princeton has two societies, the 'Clio"" and the ""Whig,"" between which there exists a strong rivalry. At Har- vard are the ""Union' and the ""Forum.' Columbia, Williams, and the University of North Carolina also have each two rival societies for such training. Harvard and Columbia allow the greatest freedom of com- petition for places on the team. A public meeting is held, when a cer-                 tain subject is announced for argument. Candidates may speak on ei- ther side; and from these, a committee of the faculty selects the suc- cessful debaters. As there are sometimes a large number of contestants, the meeting is not a brief one. At Yale there are preliminary trials in each of the several departments of the University. The successful men  compete before a committee of professors for final choice. The chief factor in training men at New Haven is the Yale Union, the debating organization of the academic departments. There is a sep- arate union among the freshmen, which debates with the Harvard fresh- men. The University of Michigan has, in its Literature Department, four societies , by a series of trials, decide upon their best three men, who compete with representatives of the Law Department for places on the team. At Dartmouth each of the fraternities, as well as the "" Neutrals,"" or non-fraternity men, presents its best speakers, from whom the choice is made. Several colleges, notably Harvard and Cornell, have made systematic training in debate a part of the regular curricu- lum. This  is always apparent in the final debate, and often results in victory where the opposing college has no such system.                 After the debaters are selected, the first task in preparing for an intercollegiate contest is the choice of a question for discussion. This is done in accordance  the debating constitution which the opposing colleges have adopted. Often one party has the privilege of submitting several topics, of  its opponents select one; choosing the side on which it prefers to stand. These positions are reversed the follow- ing year. With Yale, Harvard, and Princeton, the home college selects the question; while the visiting debaters are entitled to choice of side. In other cases this point is decided by lot. The Central Debating League above-mentioned departs from the usual practice; the selection of both judges and question being made by a council composed of alumni of the institutions interested. These methods leave each college with well-defined positions approximately equal in-desirability. In the case of a seemingly unfair question, such an equality is often produced by loading one side with conditions, or by giving it additional points to prove. For example: With the subject, ""Resolved, That municipalities should own and operate plants for supplying gas,"" the difficulty of the negative side is enhanced by adding the proviso, ""if such action would not increase official corruption'; and the burden of the affirmative is made heavier by including in the question not only plants for supply- ing gas, but also those for furnishing water, electricity, and surface transportation.                 The questions chosen to-day are very different from those discussed in the local debates of forty years ago. At that time such subjects as the following were in vogue; viz., ""Resolved, That ambition is a stronger incentive to action than fear."" ""Resolved, That the existence and at- tributes of the Supreme Being can be proved without the aid of divine revelation."" These topics would hardly evoke the interest that was felt when Harvard and Yale recently discussed the annexation of Hawaii; Dartmouth and Williams, the city  of public franchises; Cornell and the University of Pennsylvania, the compulsory arbitration of labor disputes; and the University of Michigan and Northwestern University, the Government construction of the Nicaragua Canal. In short, at present a successful debate must involve a live issue.                 The question having been chosen, the real work of preparation begins. Every book and authority pertinent to the subject must be thoroughly canvassed, every telling point secured, every probable argu- ment of the other side investigated and answers prepared. In fact, each detail must be completely absorbed and understood in all its bear- ings. If the question be one involving a law or custom in any locality, numerous letters must be written and, sometimes, visits made to dis- cover proof of its success or failure. A certain Wisconsin college, which was to argue the Prohibition Question, sent representatives to Maine for the purpose of observing the operation of the prohibitory law of that State. It is hardly necessary to say, however, that such long pilgrimages are not of common occurrence.                 Frequently this preparatory labor is supplemented by practice in the home college, whereby the team is  and strengthened by trial de- bates on the question; being opposed by the best debaters available. In some cases the three speakers and the alternate discuss the subject in public: two are on either side. They are thus given a better  of the arguments they must meet. At Yale, a further improvement is proposed, by choosing not only the three regular debaters, but also three others who will act as a permanent "" scrub"" team, the members of which will have the hope of replacing the ""Varsity"" men by doing good work in these practice disputes.                 Thus it will be seen that the preparation for an intercollegiate debate involves a large amount of work. In consideration of this the colleges have different methods of recognizing their representatives, on the same principle that they  their foot-ball and base-ball cham- pions by allowing them to wear the initial of the college on cap or sweater. For instance, Yale disputants are given handsome gold watch-                 charms, bearing on one side the head of Demosthenes, and, on the other, the name of the owner, and the debate in which he is to take part. This college also offers several prizes to the best debaters; and, by agreement with Yale, Harvard, and Princeton, the winning team receives a trophy banner, which is hung in some conspicuous spot for future admiration. Similarly the Williams debaters are rewarded with pins or watch-charms; while Harvard and a number of the other col- leges show their appreciation by the gift of "" shingles,' or certificates, to the effect that the owner has represented his Almwa Hater in de- bate. These somewhat resemble college diplomas in appearance, though more ornate, and are sometimes elaborately engraved and beautified. The University of Michigan has a more practical mode of recompense. Her debaters receive $75, $50, and $30 respectively. Money rewards are given in many other colleges.                 Team-work is almost as important in debate as in foot-ball or row- ing; and, as the aggregate amount of time allowed to each side is seldom over fifty minutes, a team, to win, must use every second to advantage. To secure this result, it is usually best for a team to maintain the special line of thought agreed upon beforehand, and shun the alluring challenges and interpolations of the other side. This was illustrated not long ago in a debate between two of our greatest universities having equal chances of victory. At the outset, one party challenged its oppo- nent to answer several skilfully put questions. The bait was accepted; and several precious moments were used in the responses. As a result, the questioned side had to omit, or cut short, its own carefully prepared and important arguments. At the close of the debate, the questioners calmly showed that neither interrogations nor answers had any actual bearing on the subject; and, having employed their own time to ad- vantage, they won the debate.                 At times, also, the exclusive possession of some important informa- tion, withheld until the final moment and then emphasized to the greatest extent, will outweigh former arguments and secure the judges' deci- sion. Cornell won from the University of Pennsylvania last March by throwing on the latter the burden of proof with so adroit and fierce an onslaught that they had to accept it, and place themselves on the defensive,-a position almost invariably leading to defeat. On the other hand, rebuttal work must not be neglected; only it should be reserved for its proper place, and should not interfere with the main arguments. To her excellence in such use of the rebuttal are attributed the successive victories of Yale over Harvard for the past three years;                 and her defeats by Princeton were caused by tlhe still greater superior- ity of the ""Tigers"" in this same particular.                 Formerly aid from the faculty was a great factor. One distin- guished instructor even claimed that the team of his college was tri-  because of superior learning  the professors. This would be hardly possible at present; for faculty assistance, except to a very limited extent, is considered a violation of ethics, as being to debating vhat professionalism is to athletics.                 In spite of all possible labor and skill, the element of luck some- times decides debating contests as well as other struggles. A sudden confusion or forgetfulness, or an attack of illness, has not seldom brought about an  defeat.                 The debates between two colleges are held alternately at each, in some hall on the campus or other public building. A speaker is al- lowed from ten to fifteen minutes; and each address on the affirmative precedes one on the negative. When all have spoken, the leader of the affirmative makes a rebuttal speech of about five minutes; summing up the entire argument and pointing out the weak points of the opposition. The leader on the negative then  a similar course. With the larger universities all the speakers are allowed short rebuttals. Next comes the decision of the judges,-usually three in number,-who are prominent alumni of both colleges, or noted  and statesmen.                 As the debaters are becoming more expert, the public interest in their forensic battles is increasing. Those between important colleges are decided by men of the highest rank and ability, and are heard by thousands. Indeed, it is often difficult to secure a hall of sufficient size to accommodate the audience. Among the older alumni there is per- haps a stronger desire that their Alma Hater should be triumphant in an important debate than in an athletic contest. Also, from the under- graduates, in both Eastern and Western colleges, debating must con- tinue to receive increasing attention; since, though involving much confining labor, it leads directly to the professions which many of them will pursue in after-life. To prospective members of the bar, especially, such work is of the greatest advantage; for "" every law-case is a debate.'                 During the last few months some notable and instructive debates have talken place. In April occurred the annual contest  Yale and Princeton, at which Ex-President Cleveland presided. On that occasion, Yale defeated the New Jersey university for the first time in several years. Princeton's ill luck continued; for again, in May, she surren- dered to Harvard, who supported the affirmative of the question, ""Se-                 solved, That the present restrictions on immigration into the United States ar-e insufficient."" The victory of the crimson seemed due to judicious combinations of prepared  and extemporaneous re- buttal. Probably a verdict was never more quickly agreed upon, as the judges required less than  minutes for consultation. Somewhat similar in this respect was the WVilliams-Dartmouth debate a few days later. The decision in that case was practically reached before the men had ceased speaking; although the formality of a 6on was ob- served. The victory came to Williams, which maintained the negative of a proposition to reform the laws of Massachusetts relating to taxation. This result was secured by careful selection of the important arguments and by clearness of presentation. Another interesting debate was held at Ann Arbor between the Universities of Michigan and Chicago. The former affirmed, "" That the action of the Senate in rejecting the proposed treaty of arbitration  the United States and England, was wise."" The decision was in favor of the University of Michigan on the ground of effective team-work and excellent delivery. The Chicago debaters lost in relatively unimportant objections the time necessary to advance constructive arguments to meet those of their opponents. The first de- bate of the new league between Dartmouth and Brown was won by the former because of superior work in rebuttal. All of these contests were characterized by a noticeably greater display of perceptive power, logic, and oratory than those of previous years.                 In general, the present system of intercollegiate discussion can hardly fail to commend itself to all interested in educational progress; for, in this way, the powerful incentive of college spirit and rivalry, of individual competition and success, supplies what is so often lacking in the student s labor, and is so necessary to his advancement-the feeling of personal intimacy and personal enthusiasm.

From the corners of the artistic universe, Professor Lane Cooper has collected in ""Methods and                 Aims in the Study of Literature"" (Ginn) an admirable series of extracts designed primar- ily for advanced colege classes. The first section of the book, ""On Method in General,"" draws  from Leonardo da Vinci, Milton,                 Kenyon Cox, Agassiz, and others as diverse, in an endeavor to discover the bond between science and art. All of this is highly - ing to careful thought, though the underlying unity of method in science and art is perhaps not so fruitful a conception as the funda- mental distinctions between the two. The subsequent divisions deal with the practice of great writers in composing (with emphasis on revision), the reading of great poets, and, as a concluding illustration of the principles previously stressed, ""Method in the Poetry of Love."" Although Professor Cooper's book is concerned with method rather than with                 matter, and would therefore need to be sup- plemented, for practical use, with a book or with lectures on literature as an interpretation of life, it does excellently what imperatively needs to be done,- it makes perfectly clear the rigorous discipline without which the writer is foredoomed to oblivion. This is made impressive physiologically, so to speak, through the extracts from Dorothy Words- worth s ""Journals,"" in which William is recorded as constantly tiring himself with labor on ""The Pedlar,"" and sleeping very ill, and even keeping the dinner waiting till four o clock. The editor has happily included his own ""Glance at Wordsworth's Reading,"" re- printed from ""Modern Language Notes.""                 A  of                 Wait Whitman,.                 Mr. Edward Carpenter has said of Walt Whitman's influence, ""I find it difficult to imagine what                 my life would have been without it,"" and he has also, on the same page of his own chief work, emphasized the fact of his own distinc- tive qualities of mind and heart and - tion, thus: ""Anyhow, our temperaments, standpoints, antecedents, etc., are so entirely diverse and opposite that, except for a few points, I can hardly imagine that there is much real resemblance to be traced."" Exactly what is the nature of the younger man s in-  to the older is expressed by Mr. Edward Lewis in his book, ""Edward Carpen- ter: An Exposition and an Appreciation"" (Macmillan), in ""the figure of speech that Whitman played the part of a midwife in the deliverance of Carpenter's spiritual child."" Mr. Lewis's chapters naturally concern them- selves to a great extent with ""Toward Democ- racy,"" its writer s most elaborate expression of his creed, and in form and substance an inevitable reminder of ""Leaves of Grass."" But if its writer harked back to Whitman in this work, he anticipated another master, Professor Bergson, in some thoughts to which he gave utterance in a later important book, ""The Art of Creation."" These two works, with others of narrower scope, from the same pan, are made to illuminate the dozen chapters that set forth the doctrine of this remarkable teacher, while the opening and closing pages are given to more purely personal aspects of the man. The book is provided with portrait, index, and footnotes. It is a warmly sympa- thetic treatment of its theme.

If, however, we desire to estimate them more seri- ously, it will be enough to read the essay on Emerson. Emerson and Longfellow, Professor Peck thinks, are the greatest American authors, or at least the two                 who are surest of surviving; and of the two, he thinks Emerson the greater, because while Long. fellow has "" beauty and fitness of form "" Emerson has "" intellectual quality."" We may suppose of the latter, then, that he is worth serious effort. But if we look to see what Professor Peck has to say on Emerson's intellectuality, we find only that Emerson has no system of philosophy, that he is a fountain of isolated thought, that he was a champion of intel- lectual freedom, that he gave supreme devotion to the doctrine of an intense individualism, and that he teaches in aphorisms. Now as these are matters that everyone is familiar with who has read a text-book of literature, we may ask how a man could proceed to a study of Emerson knowing less, and if he gained no more what could be the nature of his study ? If we may judge from these "" studies,"" Professor Peck is not a student in the ordinary sense: he is one who picks up commonplaces about people and things, and expresses them in a smart and chirpy style which furnishes his readers a moderate degree of entertain- ment. But the knack of using a breezy style for giving distinction to the commonplace, of saying dis- putable things in such a cock-sure vay, is one that may be overworked; and the reader comes to feel that Professor Peck does push this dependence pretty far.                 A oUtide to                 Shake,pea,ia, c,,n.                 Dr. Charles F. Johnson's "" Shake- speare and his Critics"" (Houghton) is a most useful book - a veritable                 literary Baedeker. It attempts to outline the entire field of Shakespearean criticism, both textual and literary, - British, American, and foreign. No previous work has tried to cover this wide field. The judgments of Professor Johnson upon the vari- ous critics are well considered. His own incidental comments upon the many questions that arise are penetrating and valuable, and are choicely expressed. The book is evidently the ripe fruit of many years of study and reflection. It seems strange, however, that although the work gives much space to Amer- icans the name of Henry N. Hudson is not men- tioned. In accuracy, and in some of the details of book-making, the work is faulty. Many titles are ; e.g., ""the Stationer's Book,"" ""the New Shakespearean Society."" Thatan - tion of Rowe (p. 88) and a reading of a First Quarto (p. 90) should be attributed to Pope, is perhaps pardonable. Graver mistakes are: the statement that "" Lear is carried from Leicester to Dover ""; the omission of ""' Love's Labour's Won "" from Meres's list of Shakespeare's plays (1598); and the giving of the name WVilliam Kyd to the supposed author of the lost play of ""Hamlet."" On page 52 a quotation from Kipling is dreadfully mangled. A chief defect in the book is that the paragraphs cited from the critics and the many passages quoted from Shake- speare himself are not located. The latter are often cited because containing typical emendations. Since the information given by Professor Johnson in these cases is necessarily scanty, and is not always entirely                 accurate, the failure to give exact references is unfor- tunate. In spite of its defects, the book is cordially commended as a helpful guide to the more important literature concerning Shakespeare.                 Plu7                 chapters on olt                 Greek                  To deliver the Lane Lectures for 1908, Harvard University was for- tunate enough to secure Dr. J. B.                 Bury, Regius Professor of History in the University of Cambridge. The lecturer chose as his general theme "" The Ancient Greek Historians ""; and the addresses are now published in an interesting vol- umne (MNlacmillan). Long ago Professor Bury estab- lished a reputation for penetrating criticism and genuine historical acumen, as well as for felicity of presentation; and all these qualities are manifest in the present work. His pen passes illuminatingly from ""The Rise of Greek History"" to the later historians and "" The Influence of Greek on Roman Historiography."" The least satisfactory pages are those dealing with Roman writers; and the lectures as printed would have been little poorer if these had been omitted. The most interesting chapters are probably the two on Thucydides, where Professor Bury is at his best. The index is adequate, and the  so, although the latter might have been enlarged without including negligible studies. The volume is appropriately dedicated to Mr. Gar- diner M. Lane, ""1 who founded the lectureship some years ago in the interests of humanistic study."" Those of us  have followed Professor Bury's writings, and have also happened to hear him speak, must envy his auditors at Harvard as we turn these pages. The next best thing for those who are inter- ested in the subject wiU be to read the book.                 Civill-Har times in the old Soutth.                 Mr.Thomas Cooper DeLeon, prolific author and playwright, well known for his ""Confederate Memories,"" his                 ""Four Years in Rebel Capitals,"" and his ""Life of General Joseph Wheeler,"" has produced another book of Southern souvenirs and character sketches entitled ""Beles, Beaux, and Brains of the 60's"" (Dillingham). Born in South Carolina, four years in the Confederate service, and now a resident of Mobile, the author is a thorough Southerner, "" dyed in the wool,"" and his chatty and attractive volume proves it . In his very first chapter, in a characteristic protest against Mrs. Stowe's un-  picture of the slaveholder, it is pointed out that the brutality toward the negro detailed in "" Uncle Tom's Cabin"" is aU committed by a Yankee overseer. Life and society in Richmond, Washington, and  in the lower latitudes of our broad land, are recalled with many illustrative anecdotes and references to historic events and famous char- acters. The portraits scattered through the volume are almost beyond counting, and help to vitalize these pages from a vanished past. The book will interest  those older readers of Southern antecedents who are fond of recalling good old times "" before the war.""                 Lea reg from the life of a                 Tusrki.h lacy.                 "" Haremlik "" (Houghton) is the work of Denietra Vaka, now Mlrs.

Mrs. Brown visited Constantinople again after six years in this country, and found her girl friends pro- vided -for the most part comfortably and happily provided - with a fraction of a husband apiece. She claims to furnish an impartial account of the working of a  , like other systems, is compounded of good and evil; but her own conclu- sion, both as to the merits of what she saw and the manner in which nations and individuals  be allowed to find their way to the light, is evidently expressed in her word to the Turkish ""suffragettes "": "" Since you do not like your system, - although it seems to me admirable on the whole, -it is only right that you should be allowed to live your lives as you want to. Only, you must go about it in a sensible way, and take into consideration the others who are involved in it.""  may be the book s value as  evidence for the sociol- ogist, - and it is probably not impersonal enough or general enough to give it a great deal of value in that direction, - it is stirringly , and two or three little incidents of childhood companionships, in particular, are told almost as prettily as anything of the kind in literature                 The                  of the  .                 From the industrious pen of the Rev. P. H. Ditchfield there las appeared a Ltood-sized volume of clerical anec-                 dotes and legend and history, under the attractive title, "" The Old-time Parson "" (E. P. Dutton & Co.). The same author issued not long ago a well-received work on "" The Parish Clerk,"" and now deems it "" only fair that the occupant of the  tier of the ' three-decker' should share his honour."" A friend of the writer placed at his disposal "" a manuscript collection of clerical stories"" which lie had been get- ting together for many years. Consequently there is no lack of illustrative anecdote in the book; and as clerical wit is proverbially of good quality, the volume yields abundant entertainment. The Saxon parson and the mediaeval parson have each a chapter, neces- sarily  short, to themselves. Chaucer's ""poor parson of a  "" is of course presented in the poet s own descriptive verse, and "" Piers Plowv- man"" is made to furnish a pertinent passage. But the chapter on ""The Parson in Literature "" might easily bave been extended to include more of the familiar pulpit-founders of fiction. Charlotte Bronte, for example, has pictured the country curate with a pitiless fidelity that should not be passed over. Among the witty parsons, Dr. South and Bishop Wil-  figure , and Robert Stephen Hawker fails not to appear among the eccentric parsons. Numerous portraits and other illustrations contribute their share of interest to the volume.                 Traneforynafions in the world of  life.                 From the facts of paleontology comes the evidence which in the last analysis most definitely and cogently attests                 that in the  ot the living things which people the earth there has been an organic evolution or transformation. A book which marshals the data of paleontology and shows their bearing on the prob- lems of evolution is particularly timely in the year when all over the world men are doing honor to the memory of Darwin. Such a book is Al. Charles Deperets ""Transformation of the Animal World,"" the latest addition to the ""International Scientific Series"" (Appleton). In these days when the dominant trend in the investigation of evolution problems is to apply the experimental method, it is refreshing to be brought back once in a while to the literally as well as metaphorically solid evolutionary record afforded by the fossils. Broadly speaking, the aim of the present book may be said to be to show, on the basis of the paleontological data now in hand, the phyletic history of the larger groups of animals existing to-day. Doing this furnishes the occasion for discussing the probable methods through                  the observed transformation of animals may be held to have occurred, and also for outlining briefly the history of opinion on these points. Occasionally the translator (F. Legge) slips up on a technical detail, but in general the style is accurate and pleasing.                 A i out-door book fol M1.                 It was high time that someone wrote an out-door book for Midsummer, and the only defect in Mr. Winthrop                 Packard's ""Wild Pastures"" (Small, Maynard & Co.) is that the title does not indicate the scope and character of -the work. Somewhere in his Eastern Massachusetts pasture MIr. Packard has discovered a spring of words that express, as nearly as it would seem that words can express, the magic of the "" Arabian days "" of June, July, and August. Here where the "" Cosmos of the wild has wiped out that curious chaos which we call civilization "" lie waylays the dawn of June mornings and ""' stalks"" the wild grape whose fragrance makes him "" dream of pipes of Pan playing in the morning of the world, while all the wonder creatures of the old Greek myths dance in rhythm and sing in soft undertones, and the riot of young life bubbles within them."" Beside the pasture brook in the hot  days he gets glimpses of the life of the rock-bass and horn-pout, and in the -ht nights he watches the witch faces on the hazel-bushes ""1 detach themselves from the limbs, put on their red caps and sail off across the great yellow disk "" of the full moon. He watches the bluebirds and tanagers with as much interest in their moulting as he has taken in their nesting, and is acquainted with the personnel and separate instru- ments of the frog-pond orchestra. Through the long summer drought he sees how there is ""in all the pasture people a certain puritanical sternness of de- meanor, a set holding-fast to the narrowing good of life, a tightening of the muscles that are weary with a long strain but may not for the good of the soul                 loose their firm grip,"" until the first Fall rain releases them from their suffering. The book is satisfactory for not attempting too much, and  what it attempts delicately and well. A few draw- ings by MIr. Copeland help the reader to visualize the text.

The aim of the compilers has been to supply an anthology which may adequately represent the vast and varied field of English poetry. It is not pretended that all the inns-  of the poets are included, nor are the                 *Tna ENousu PozTs. Selections, with Critical Introduc- ions by various writers, and a ( Introduction by Mat- :hew Arnold. Edited by Thomas  Ward, M.A. London cud New York: Macmillan & Co.                 of all writers who have place in the history of English poetry represented. ""The                 has been to collect as many of the best and most characteristic of  writings as should fairly represent the great poets, and at the same time to omit no one who is, poetically, considerable."" The writings of living poets, and the drama properly so called, are not in- cluded, as this would extend the  of  threefold. Productions, however, like "" Comnus "" and "" The Gentle Shepherd,"" as well as songs from the dramatists, have not  omitted. The space allotted to the different authors has been fairly distributed, and where an author is represented by only one or two pieces these will be found invariably to be the most expressive of his genius. It is difficult to see how a better, more judicious, impartial, and characteristic selection of British poetry could be made than the one under consideration. There has certainly been brought to this deli- cate task an amount of knowledge, exquisite taste, andl highly trained literary sagacity, that is as  to modern scholarship as it is admirable and instructive.                 The biographical and critical introductions  preface the respective selections were written by those whose studies and sympathies specially ( them for the several tasks assigned to them. It is not too much to say that the work in each case is a model of comn- pact, lucid, and forceful statement, giving in the briefest compass compatible with clearness what should be stated as a fair delineation of the author s life and writings. These notices have a vivacity of style, a  insight, a candor anil , whichi mark them as first-class productions of their kind. Space does not allow us to fortify these remarks by quotations.                 A notable feature of the work is the General Introduction by Matthew Arnold. To say that it is  satisfactory does not fully express our view of it. We doubt  there is, in equal limits, in the English language a treatise on poetry as wise, as profound, as rich in truth, as this. That Mr. Arnold is, by natu- ral gift and  and moral equipment, coin-  to do justice to  subject, needs iio  here. This is a field in which he is master, where he speaks as one having authority by right of his own knowledge and . He is a poet himself, of fine genius and splendid accomplishment, whose admirers                 are among the most cultivated readers and lovers of English verse. He has that spiritual breadth, that clearness of vision, that powerful intellectual fibre, that intense love of beauty anid truth, and that noble scorn of all hollow- ness and pretence, that peculiarly fit him for the most accurate, thorough, and discriminating criticism. And here, in the compass of some thirty pages, he has given his estimate of poetry -its province, uses, and destiny. As simple reading, for graceful lucidity and directness and force of style, it is entirely charming; but regarded on the  ground of profound, , and  criticism, it is simply superb. This Introduction can stand as a permanent monograph of what is vital, enduring, and  in poetry. Such a  of the divine art, sueh an un-  of its real elements from what is merely meretricious and pretentious in verse, is in the  sense useful and gratifying to all wilo appreciate the sublime utility of the most inspiring literature. The principles set forth in this Introduction, besides their useful. iess to the general reader, whieh is their chief aim, have a direct application to all who par- ticipate in the production or publication of verse. The fault of a good deal of American and perhaps English poetry that has appeared, even through highly respectable channels, during the last fifteen or twenty years, is its lack of matter and substance, its dependence for effects on mere verbal dexterity, its want of profound seriousness. There has grown up  may be called a ""school"" with these , whose verse, while commend- able  in diction and movement, is lamentably deficient in the higher qualities of poetry. It has to be confessed that this is not a poetry-reading . It is doubtful  even those who keep fairly informed in  literature have much acquaintance with the English classics or any high standard in their minds of poetic excellence. Editors of prominent magazines, in catering to what has seemed to them a popular demand, have encourage( the production of a kind of decora- tive -verse  deep sincerity, with- out a  for nature, without substance and lofty motive, whose chief merit is its tasteful coloring, its portrayal of unfamiliar situations, its curious conceits and graceful movement. None of our older poets are open to these strictures,  the exception of Poe, and huis                 strange genius redeems somewhat his - tions and unreality. We think we see some indications that this decorative school is on the wane. Such a work as this is a good antidote to its influence. It is true that there may be real poetry which has but few of the  that mark the highest. The danger, however, is that the lower qualities may be preferred to the higher, because they are superficially more attractive. A keen poetic sense will appreci- ate whatever is truly poetic of any school or age, but its admiration will be graduated ac- cording to the real merit of the production. The cultivation of this sense or faculty to its noblest capacity of discovery and enjoyment, is its own great reward. That is a poor com-  to poetry which prefers, for instance, Will Carleton's ballads to Lowell's, and Edgar Fawcett to Bryant. The great thing is to have the sense of truth and beauty so strong, the standard of excellence in our minds so correct, that while always preferring the best poetry we shall detect at once what is good from whatever quarter it comes. It is to this attainment that Matthew Arnold invites us in the study of the noble  before us. These volumes will not be superfluous in any library, however richly furnished; while  can supply their place in homes of culture and refinement. HORATIO N. .

They discuss Individuals, such as Lord Shaftesbury, Cardinal Manning, Lord Houghton and Lord Beaconsfield; and such subjects as Religion and Morality, Solial Amelioration, Pirliamentary Oratory, Conversation, Epitaphs, the Art of Putting Things, Letter Writing, etc. The author is not without the power of speaking sharply, but writes In a genial temper and with a Judicious blending of the serious and the droll. Some of his anecdotes are ""chestnuts,"" but most of them probably will seem fresh, to American readers. A few relate to America or Americans, but most of them are English. On the whole, there 18                 more which Is novel and amusing In the way of reminiscence and anecdote than such books usually offer. We are glad to see that the author firmly believes in the substantial and even rapid progress of society toward a better condition. Signs of this progress he discerns In greater reverence for religion than was observable in his boyhood, in the gradual decline of many social practices which, if not absolutely wrong, were unwholesome, and in the general toning up of society to a nobler and more useful view and practice of human life. He Is no optimist, In the sense of shutting his eyes to what Is amiss, but he has lived long enough and has observed with sufficient closeness to perceive the solid gain in many worthy directions which has been made. It goes without saying that such a book abounds in interest, not only to the American who is more or less familiar with England, but to everybody, and the delineations of character which it contains are very keen and fair. Its portrayals of Lord Beaconsfield, for example, and of Mr. Gladstone are not likely to please entirely the warm admirers of either great man, but justify themselves nevertheless. We heartily commend the book as well adapted for summer reading, and also as a permanent addition to the library.                 In Glimapses of England, Social, Political, Literary [G. P. Putnam's Sons. $1.25] Professor Moses Colt Tyler of Cornell has gathered together a number of letters written from England in 1863-1865. They recall for us the England of that day In the crisis of our own national history, and suggest the many changes which have come since then both In England and America. Disraeli and Gladstone were contending In the days when these letters were written, and Bright and Mill were In the prime of their strength. There Is an amusing chapter on English hallucinations about Amerlea, In which the opinions that Americans are black and do not speak English, joined to a ludicrous Ignorance of American geography, are shown to have been prevalent at that time. After this exhibition of so recent English Ignorance and lack of Interest one can hardly wonder at the density of Spanish Ignorance today; but England has learned to know us better, and Spain Is learning In a costly school. These chapters of English life, as observed by a resident American, are both entertaining and instructive.

In discussing the first edition of Ahlfeld's work we stated that there were two kinds of text books--one compilation of the literature and clippings from other works and another type usually less pretentious and more modest in appearance but which shows originality in every line and reflects the author s personal experience and views                 Ahlfeld's work is splendid representative of this second type It is Ahlfeld's own handiwork and not machine-made article figure clad in homespun and not puppet dressed in garment of many colors                 The first edition deserved the predicate good and this much-enlarged second edition should receive the mark excellent Many of the shortcomings of the first edition have been obviated the author having paid due attention to many honest criticisms which especially found fault with the method in which- the various chapters were arranged The chapter on the physiology of pregnancy and labor is well written In the former however we desire to criticise Figure 58, which is said to illustrate the normal position of the full-term uterus in primipara In our opinion the position is decidedly abnormal and the illustration would well fit description of pendulous belly Ahlfeld advises the preliminary vaginal douche even in normal cases this however does not surprise us for Ahlfeld is strong believer in The chapter on the physiology of the puerperium contains little that is knew We desire however to take exception to the advice that the patient may leave her bed without any danger three or four days post partum We grant that this may be possible in exceptional cases but it would certainly be inadvisable in most women In the treatment of eclampsia Ahlfeld takes conservative position and opposes the radical treatment of Diihrssen and others who advise the immediate emptying of the uterus Hot baths and wet pack are advised to which in especially grave cases chloroform anesthesia or morphine injections may be added We fully agree with Ahlfeld in the treatment of complicating pregnancy that is not to operate in these cases except the tumors should render delivery impossible The chapter discussing the complications of labor as result of preceding vesico- or vaginal-fixation of the uterus is new and interesting This operation is decidedly unjustifiable during the child-bearing period and if we are not mistaken the signs are many that it will soon be discarded The chapter on puerperal sepsis is concise conservative and up to date As might be expected the etiology of finds prominent place The book closes with brief recapitulation of the diseases of the new- born infant We wish to draw especial attention to the chapter on gonorrheal infection which contains many valuable points We heartily recommend this work to both the student and physician as safe and reliable guide Urinary Analysis and Diagnosis By Louis Heitzmann New York With 108 original illustrations New York William Wood Company 1899. It would seem at first glance as if any writer guilty of new work on the urine owed distinct apology to the medical profession If Dr Heitzmann owes any such apology it is for having delayed so long in giving us book so greatly needed Every physician realizes the importance of urine examination                 Nearly every one regards himself as more or less of an expert at it As rule his microscope has been bought with that end in view and with bacteria and blood work as secondary possibility and yet there can be no doubt that many man who examines hundreds of specimens every year will take beautiful sediment every feature of which should tell something as it passes under the objective and yet know little more about the urinary tract of his patient when he has finished the examination than he did when he began it The reason for this is obvious The standard works on the urine give much space to minute chemical analysis work which can only properly be done in fully equipped laboratory -and the microscopical portion of the subject is relegated to very subsidiary position This will be more clearly evident when it is mentioned that in the book on this subject which is probably the most popular at present in this country there is not one original plate of urinary sediments And this book is not an exception It is in many ways an excellent work and quite typical of the books which we depend upon to instruct us in this line To see the evil effect of this teaching it is only necessary to send specimen of urine in doubtful case to the laboratories where such examinations are made for the profession An elaborate chemical analysis with most meagre microscopical report will be returned It happened recently to the writer of this review to see in consultation patient with The urine from the case had been sent to the pathologist of large institution and the report was at hand to help in the diagnosis It consisted of chemical analysis figured in most scientific-looking decimals and with microscopical appendix which read as follows Pus cells numerous red blood cells in fair number epithelial cells of the squamous and spindleshaped varieties crystals of -magnesian phosphate amorphous phosphates no casts Considering the fact that the pus was entirely evident to the naked eye in this specimen there is absolutely nothing in the report which can be said to add jot to the clinical picture or help the practitioner in the slightest degree In fact if anything it is misleading as rather suggesting the bladder as the source of the pus That this is typical urinary report think any one who has had experience in this direction will agree And yet in the case in question an absolutely positive diagnosis of abscess of the kidney could easily be made with the microscope in five minute Mixed with the pus corpuscles there were to be found myriads of cuboidal and columnar epithelia from the convoluted and straight collecting tubules of the kidney These in the laboratory report had undoubtedly been classed as pus corpuscles In justice to the laboratory where the examination in question was made it should be remembered that failure to recognize the source of the various epithelia found in urine is quite in accordance with the teaching of the text books and shows what great need there is for work such as Dr Heitzmann                 has given us In the urine above mentioned moreover there could be seen in every field shreds of connective tissue certainly most important feature as showing destructive change and yet these shreds are not mentioned in the report The reason for this omission is as simple as it is amazing the text books do not any of them mention the possibility of finding important anatomical element in urine In reviewing book as full of meat as Dr Heitzmann's it is difficult to know where to begin and where to stop Each chapter suggests new text Probably the most important portion of the book is that devoted to epithelia It will be remembered as stated above that at present the weight of authority is against the possibility of determining the sources of the various epithelia found in the urine Dr Heitzmann takes the opposite view and states that while in every urine many epithelia will be found whose source cannot possibly be told still on the average it is entirely possible to tell Those who are inclined to hastily criticise this position as untenable should not forget that this book is the outcome of many years of painstaking work in limited field by an extremely competent and well-trained observer While it is not possible in brief review to state Dr Heitzmann's position in detail it may be said that his method of differentiating epithelia from the various parts of the urinary tract is not based on peculiarities of shapes as suggested years ago by Sir William Roberts but upon comparative average sizes For instance where small cuboidal epithelia are found which are one-third larger than the pus corpuscles found in the same urine these epithelia come from the convoluted tubules of the kidney As the epithelia from the ureters and prostate are only slightly larger than those from the kidney being according to Dr Heitzmann about twice the size of the pus corpuscles it is evident that care and discrimination are necessary in making the diagnosis It is the opinion of the writer of this review however that this care will be well repaid for it has been his practical experience that where the urine contains pus corpuscles and cuboidal epithelia one-third larger than the pus corpuscles there will invariably be clinical evidences of more or less nephritis and the practitioner who takes the trouble to follow up this subject will be glad to find that he is able readily to detect the many gradations of nephritis which precede the cast stage and to see his cases of so-called functional albuminuria becoming fewer Dr Heitzmann's chapter on Casts is excellent and the portion relating to pseudo-casts is of great value as it is unfortunately fact that mucous casts and bacterial casts are only too often raised to dignity they are not entitled to Even careful insurance examiners have been known to call these appearances hyaline and granular casts The chapters on Connective Tissue on Tumors and on Extraneous Matters and the part on Urinary Diagnosis are all excellent                 Regarding the chemical part of the book there is not much to say except that it is short practical and distinctly secondary to the microscopical part to which it is added in order to make the work complete There are two hundred and thirteen pages in the microscopical part with one hundred and eight original drawings from nature and only twenty-seven pages in the chemical part an eminently satisfactory apportionment from the standpoint of actual clinical value to the practitioner To sum up it is subject for congratulation that we have now book which does away with the old time honored plates which each text book seems to have inherited from its predecessor and gives us some crisp new plates drawn to definite scale It is also subject for congratulation to find book which while adding much that is new at the same time simplifies the whole subject and materially clears the atmosphere The International Medical Annual and Practitioner's Index Work of Reference for

By ByRoN R. ELLIOTT and WILLIAM P. ELLIOTr. IndianapolisandKansasCity: TheBowen-MerriUCompany. 1894                 This work comprises two volumes of about 620 pages of text each. Volume one is devoted exclusively to the work of preparation, and the plan is admir- ably conceived and worked out, and with a precision which speaks well for the author s practical knowledge of the rules governing  and arrange- ment. Mr. Mill, in his great work on Logic, preparatory to entering upon his discussion of Induction, says that a complete logic of the sciences is a complete logic of practical business or common life. ""'True it is,"" says he, ""that in the case of the practical inquirer, * * * such, for instance, as the advocate or                 the judge, the  lies not in the making of his inductions, but in the selection of them; in choosing from among all general propositions - tained to be true, those which furnish marks by which he may trace whether the given subject possesses or not the predicate In question. In arguing a doubtful question of fact before a jury, the general principles to which the advocate appeals are mostly in themselves, sufficiently trite, and assented to as soon as stated: his skill lies in bringing his case under those propositions or principles, in calling to mind such of the known or received maxims of prob- ability as admit of application to the case in hand, and in selecting from among them those best adapted to his object."" '                 I Mill, Logic. Book UIL, Chap. 1, 1.                 The work of preparation for trial is an inductive process, and the rules of the elementary treatises upon logic are of inestimable value in teaching how to arrive at correct premises. First of all, the advocate must learn and prepare the facts of the case for proper presentation. This subject is fully discussed in the first chapter of the work under review. To get at the facts, to arrive at the truth of the matter in controversy, requires great skill and perseverance. When the facts are firmly fastened in the mind, for the lawyer must know his case as it is, and not as he thinks it should be, his next step is to find out the rules of law bearing upon the conditions of fact in hand. By perusing Chapter II., he will find numerous valuable suggestions leading to the proper and efficient accomplishment of this purpose, such as framing his hypothesis and ascertaining the proper means to get track of the law. If the case is not brought upon the right theory, and the theory selected must be followed throughout the case, the chances of success are bad. To formulate a theory and follow it out to veri- fication forms the third chapter. Chapters IV., V. and VI. discuss "" Courts,"" ""'Judicial Officers,"" and "" Jurisdlction ""-the proper forum being a subjectof great importance. "" The time of Bringing the Action "" Is discussed In the eighth chapter, and Chapter M. suggests many precautionary steps which it is Well to have always In mind.                 The work of preparation Is a work of discovery, involving the ascertainment of the facts which constitute the minor premise, and the law which forms the major. To secure the conclusion, the judgment of the court, or the verdict of the jury, is where the real struggle begins. To get the preliminary papers, Including the summons, in proper form, and to get the case before the court, is treated in the tenth chapter, and ""Auxiliary Proceedings"" in the XI. The remaining chapters of the first volume are devoted to a discussion of ""The Instruments of Evidence,"" ""Questions of Law and Fact,"" and ""Arbitration and Award.""' This finishes the work out of court, or the Preparation.                 After the facts are properly collimated, the rules of law bearing thereon sufficiently mastered, and the proper theory formulated, or Induction chosen, the work of putting the complete case before the court, or jury, or both, as the case may be, remains. The second volume discusses the various phases of a trial of an issue of fact, somewhat after the style this subject has been already discussed in a leading work. The subjects of ""Impaneling the Jury,"" the "" Right to Open and Close,"" the ""Statement of the Case,"" the ""Delivery of the Evidence,"" and the "" Examination of Witnesses,"" are all treated, but not at the length which the Importance of those subjects deserves. Interspersed with the various doctrines and rules are valuable suggestions concerning the expediency of certain courses of conduct In regard to the examination of witnesses and in the general conduct of the trial.                 The logical and rhetorical phases of argument of counsel are treated at great  chapters XXIX., XXX. and XXXI. While this discussion may hardly come under the term "" practice,"" as understood in its strictly legal sense, still it is not effort wasted. The reviewer, in his observations and experience with the bar, has noticed, especially among country lawyers, a lack of that knowledge which would enable them to formulate and expound a ques- tion upon scientific lines. A study of these chapters in connection with such standard works on Rhetoric as those of Archbishop Whateley, Dr. Campbell, and Air. Hill, and with those such on Logic as Mill, Davis, Whateley, andl                 others, will fnd Its possessor in control of a power which will command the respect of jury, court and opposing counsel. But many lawyers lack either the time or the inclination to pursue any study outside of the strict limits of their profession; and hence the three chapters last alluded to will not be oat of place In this work.                 Chapter XXIX. is devoted to the argument to the jury, and discusses matters chiefly of a rhetorical nature. Chapter XXX. tells us how to present an arga- ment to the court in proper form. Chapter XXXI. treats of fallacies and artifices in the various stages of the trial and in the argument of counsel. This chapter is particularly, interesting and Instructive, as it embodies a coalescence of the thoughts of a great number of eminent logicians, together with those of great trial lawyers.                 The remaining chapters are devoted to trial practice, properly so called. We find set forth the subjects of "" Withdrawing the Case from the Jury,"" ""  Jury,"" "" Special Interrogatories,"" "" Special Verdicts,"" "" The Verdict and its Incidents"" "" Trial and Findings by the Court,"" "" Proceedings after Verdict and Finding,"" ""Judgments and Decrees,"" and ""Preparations for Appeal,"" all ably discussed.                 The Index Is exceptionally large and comprehensive, embracing over two hun- dred pages, and the enormous number of cases cited shows that the authors have spared no pains to give the profession a valuable and useful work. The paper, printing and binding are fully up to the average, if not above It.                 Now to sum up, about one-half of the subject-matter of this work is devoted to the discussions of "" Practice "" properly so called. The remainder, to ques- tIons of expediency, and suggestions as to the courses to be pursued in order to win.                 WiLLuA D. TnOmP8Ox.                 RACWNz, Wis.

He is reverent,  to disturb current beliefs and eager to  Christian faith and , but he has abandoned many doctrines hitherto considered fundamental. The result Is to show how little of doctrine can be believed by one still claiming to be loyal to Christ and to the church. The book is elaborate, acutely                 critical, and, although many of its claims are not to be conceded, no one will deny the author s ability, In spite of some Inconsistencies, or the propriety of his temper. That he Is a destructive critic so largely he regrets, as he admits often.                 His1 fundamental position seems to be that the burden of the support of Christian  Is transferred from history to , from the external to the Internal. He attaches vital Importance to experience. The doctrines of the gospel are not founded upon history, but are rather its outgrowth. They cannot be proved by reasoning, but are per.  views immediately based upon the sensations and facts of the spiritual life. As for the Christian. documents, reverent criticism must be allowed free course. About the teaching of Jesus we are well Informed, although critical                 progress has not enabled us . . . to set forth the purposes and character of our Master In an objective light as a part of ascertained history. . . . We must content ourselves with mere probability In place of the old fancied certainty, when we quote words as spoken by him or deeds as done by him [p. rTo].                 But It his commands were to be carried out literally, all civil government, military organization and Industrial problems would come to an end. Either he wholly lacked practical wisdom, or his commands were meant to be regarded as expressions of a tendency. If they were to be taken literally, they can be Illustrated by only a small  society in the midst of a hostile world.                 Coming-to particular doctrines, Mr. Gardner claims that the fall Is disbelieved by all educated persons; that the Trinity Is credible only experientially, God being revealed (1) In the order and law of the visible and Intellectual worlds; (2) In the life and work of Jesus Christ, both on earth and in heaven, and In ideal humanity; and (3) directly to the human heart by graces and Inspiration. As for the Incarnation, historic probability points to Nazareth rather than Bethlehem as our Lord's birthplace, and the miraculous birth cannot be accepted without  which any discriminating scholar would repudiate In secular history. Yet we cannot entirely give up the incarnation without great spiritual loss, or without injustice to the history of Christianity. Between these extremes he says many ways have been and may be taken. Which one he takes himself is left obscure. Apparently he does not abandon the doctrine, although he does not hold Its traditional form.                 As to the atonement, he admits the historic truth of Christ's death for the world, Into which he brought a new life which enabled society to survive the Inner corruption and the outward shocks which threatened the Roman empire. But the affirmation of the atonement goes far beyond history Into the realm of Ideas.                 Jesus had not long left the world, when St. Paul, in his own language, was buried with Christ and rose again with him Into newness of life. And from that day to this the  has been daily and hourly repeated In the Christian church [p. 405].                 The atonement Is a work which began In Christ's life,                 U. P. PaUtals Sons. J4.o0.                 culminated In his death and has continually been repeated all through the ages. And belief In that atonement is a Process: the process whereby, In reliance on the divine grace and by the aid of Christ, a  dies to self, to the base, to the material, and begins to live to the spiritual and to God. It does not seem to be of the greatest Importance, from this point of view, with what Intellectual form a man clothes for himself the eternal facts [p. 4061.                 The hope of Immortality is based upon  this life. The writers of the Soripture had no superhuman knowledge or virtue. Who they were and when they wrote must remain doubtful In many cases. Their books were given by God to the early Christians and for ages served to maintain faith and piety. Yet the course of history can only be  for by a divine inspiration of the Founder and his disciples, which has lasted to our times.                 In miracles the author disbelieves. In the alleged descent of Christ Into Hades he sees an adaptation of belief of the pagan mythologists known as Orphists, from whom also he thinks comes most of the Imagery In which the future world was presented to the early Christian imagination.                 These statements reveal Dr. Gardner's  from the beliefs of the Christian Church, and how much more radical his position is than that of most of the members of even the advanced school of criticism. His book Is striking In three respects. It Is a good example of criticism which, although destructive, is nevertheless reverent; It in. sists upon the vital importance of personal knowledge of God, obedience to him and the cultivation of holiness as the fundamental virtue of Christian character; and it is repeatedly shown how the great truths of the gospel, when driven out of the head, find their way back Into his belief through the heart.

By BYRON                 BRANWELL. M.D., F.R.C.P.(Edin.), Lecturer on the Principles and Practice of Medicine and on Medical Diagnosis in the Extra-Academical School of Medicine, Edinburgh, etc. With One Hundred and Eighty-Three Illustrations. Second Edition. Edinburgh, Young J. Pentland, 1884. PP. 359.                 While much has been recently written in monographs and in contributions to journals on the spinal cord and its diseases, a real need has existed for a concise and well-arranged text-book on this subject. This has now been supplied by the excellent work of Dr. Bramwell. Of the one hundred and eighty-three illustrations one-third are original, and many of them represent the results of careful and thorough microscopic work in the  of  diseases. The method                 of case-taking suggested is so useful and sensible that we would be tempted to transcribe it in full if space permitted. The book is es-                 pecially valuable for the definite and explicit instructions as to the methods of investigating cases. One hundred pages are devoted to this portion of the subject.                 Succinct practical directions are given as to the modes of using electricity in the diagnosis of cases of paralysis. Even here the author shows that he has not depended entirely upon the ordinary text-books for his matter, but has called upon experience and has gone to current literature for his facts. He notes, for instance, that in most cases of spastic paralysis which he has had the oppor. tunity of examining, simple diminution, instead of simple increase, in the electrical reaction has been present. A brief account of the partial form of the reaction of degeneration described by Remak and Erb as occurring in subacute atrophic spinal paralysis is also given. In this curious condition every kind of direct and indirect excitation of the muscles, even instantaneous stimuli, invariably produce sluggish contractions.                 Valuable tables of differential diagnosis are scattered throughout that part of the book which discusses special diseases of the cord and its envelopes.                 In the chapter on "" Concussion of the Spinal Cord, with Special Reference to the Spinal Symptoms which Result from Railway Collisions and the Method of Investigating Railway Cases,"" fortunately for scientific medicine, the work of Mr. Herbert Page has been drawn upon for the bulk of the matter, rather than the brilliant but too often misleading treatises of Erichsen.                 Pseudo-hypertrophic paralysis is discussed in an appendix, because recent observations seem to show that in it the spinal cord may be perfectly healthy.                 This book will prove of the richest value not only to the neurologist, but also to the                 student and general practitioner.                 C. J. M.

By W. B. Yeats. New York: The Macmillan Co., $z.z5.                 The leaders of the Neo-Gaelic movement are much more interesting and convincing when they talk about the Irish theater than when they publish the plays for it. We have no way of judging of the adaption of Mr. Yeats's plays to his actors and their auditors, and of their power when presented as they were intended to be, but they are- not interesting nor impressive to the ordinary reader. The first and title play of this book is, , the best that Mr. Yeats has published, and has somewhat the suggestiveness and effect of one of Maeterlinck's. It is a morality play; and its theme is to show how much easier it is to, tear down than to build up-to destroy faith than to create it.                 Between the Acts. By Henry W. NevinsonNew                 York: E. P. Dutton & Co., $2.50 net A book of short studies of certain phases of life, told in alternate stories and poems. The most pleasing of these sketches is the one treating of the life of the author s grandfather and the patriarchal household gathered about him. ""A Don's Day"" describes the purposeless man to the life. Power of decision seems to have atrophied in the mind of this unfortunate individual, whose narrow scholastic work and selfcentered life have led to an exaggerated sense of the importance of his every action and of his own conspicuousness.

[Charles Scribner's Sons. $3.50.]                 When one has at last finished the careful read- ing of a work like this, he cannot help wishing that its author might be granted a human - tality, and continue prosecuting his studies and writing his books forever. Within the compass of 700 octavo pages, out of which the publishers have made a book not over-large, Prof. Fisher has written a universal church history which for substance and spirit is a model, and which in                 many respects must and  supplant all others of equal proportions. The task is not an easy one; the mere discussion of the subject, its com- plications, involutions, and intricacies, the prob- lem of a correct perspective, the temptation to ecclesiastical bias or theological narrowness, are all against an author. But Prof. Fisher has es- caped snares with wonderful success, and reached a very high degree of excellence indeed. We think it would puzzle any one who did not know his connections to conjecture them from this book. He divides the subject into three eras - the ancient, the mediaeval, and the modern; and these eras are again sub-divided into periods: the first the apostolic, the second on to Constantine, the third to Gregory I, the fourth to Charle- magne, the fifth to Gregory VII, the sixth to Boniface VIII, the seventh to Luther's Theses, the eighth to the peace of Westphalia, the ninth to the present time. The learning throughout is affluent and exact, the style clear, dignified,                 effective, the temper judicial, temperate, Chris- tian. The Christian life, worship, and doctrine of each period are brought out by themselves in distinct pictures. Especially towards the medi-  church is Dr. Fisher just and at the same time candid. The chapters on the sub-apostolic church are singularly fresh and striking; and those on the Reformation and Christian missions full of interest. This is altogether a fine and noble work and deserves the highest praise.

MEN I HAVE KNOWN.-By She Very Revertnd                 Frederick [Y. Farrar, D. D. 8vo. T. r. CroweU & Co. $i.75.                 A GREAT many distinguished gentlemen                 number the Dean of Canterbury among .,A their most cherished friends, and are permitted                 to disclose the esteem in which they hold him in these rather artless pages. There are also a few distinguished gentlemen who have, with  reason, denied themselves the pleasure of the Dean's acquaintance, though this does not by any means deter him from including their names in the roll of honor which goes to form his table of contents. Thus in the chapter named A Group of                 Emintni Arnerka,, the name of Ralph Waldo Emerson leads all the rest. Turning to the page designated one reads: ""s Ralph Waldo Emerson I never saw. He is known to me solely by his brilliant essays, his poetry, the interesting records of his intercourse with Carlyle, and the careful appreciation of his genius by Mr. Matthew Arnold."" Yet, great as must have been the loss of Emerson, he can rest quite as contentedly as that other American of distinction - whom I visited,"" Dr. Farrar's account runs, ""1 and who died soon after.""                 Despite the success which crowned Dean Farrar's visit to this country,-and, as he reminds us, there would have been no Browning Society in Boston                 but for him,-his pages show him to be vastly better pleased at home. Some of his experiences will make the reason for this quite apparent. - It will always be a pleasant recollection that as I left Lord Beaconsfield he rose, took me by the arm, walked with me across the great reception-room and . . . said very genially, ' Dr. Farrar, I have always felt a sincere regard for you.' They were the last words I heard him speak."" Nor is this an isolated instance. When Dean Stanley heard of Dr. Farrar's appointment to a canonry at Westminster he wrote : ""nMy dear Farrar,-I shall indeed be delighted to welcome so great an accession to our Abbey staff."" In this case the Dean's delighted friend lived to say many other pleasant things; which are duly repeated. Charles Darwin, here described as "" the most epoch-making man of science in our age,"" Dean Farrar knew chiefly by letter. ,I had sent him my Origin of Languages,"" he observes, ""1 in which he had been greatly interested."" One soon comes to feel that there are few men of real note, time not forbidding, who have not been eager to lay their tribute of praise at his feet. As a necessary result there is considerable monotony in the narrative, some of it being quite as flat as a Chinese landscape, for all the l's are very tall.                 Yet Dean Farrar undoubtedly knows his audience and is right when he publishes his own portrait twice, and observes I, Every man or woman takes an interest in even seeing men of unquestioned greatness""; and he rightly asks us to recall in this connection "" I how deep was the interest with which Robert Browning looked on a man who had talked with Shelley."" These considerations should make him, in spite of all his little  for praise, not such bad reading, especially if we adopt his suggestion ' in order to get rid,"" as he phrases it, in in limine, of the notion there is anything necessarily vulgar or trivial in such a refined and modified Boswellism as may seem to be involved in slight reminiscences.""                 The book abounds in illustrative anecdotes of the autobiographer and all that is his, going back as far as "" my celebrated ancestor, the Marian , Bishop of St. David's, who was burnt alive at Caermarthen in 1 555-"" Many of these have been extensively copied since their first publication and are doubtless familiar to most readers. In collected form, however, they cannot fail to leave a better impression of their compiler s many virtues, though the humor of the book is not as well-managed as the rest of it. One reads of Dr. Short, Bishop of Sodor and Man, who so delighted in the oral questioning of children in the national schools that on one occasion he asked them ""What they supposed his besetting sin to be ? "" With one acclaim they shouted ""Drunkenness !"" but he explained that they were wrong: it was is Pride."" A companion piece to this is Dean Farrar's naive admis-                 sion, ""1 I was very diffident about myself-as a boy at King's College."" But best of all is this-with which to close:                 ""I I remember once being told by a friend that he happened to visit Carlyle just after a brilliant man of genius had left him, whom my friend had met on his way to Carlyle's door.                 '' I Ah,' said the visitor, I I have just been visiting poor Carlyle. He is a mere wreck! a mere wreck ! '                 ""1 ' So you have just had Mr. - with you,' said my friend to Carlyle.                 II 'Yes,' was the answer of the I mere wreck,' 'and he thinks God Almighty never made such another ! ' ""                 Mr. - did not know Dean Farrar.

Institut Colonial International, Brussels, oio6.                 The volume begins the seventh series of the publications of the International Colonial Institute. The series will be devoted to the legislation now in force in                 various countries relating to irrigation. Volume I treats of the irrigation laws of British India and the East (Tonkin, Annam, and the deltas of the Mekong and Menam). The succeeding volumes will deal with irrigation laws of the Dutch East Indies, Egypt, North Africa, Spain, Italy, the United States, Canada, Chile, Peru, etc.                 Volume I opens with a concise and illuminative article by Sir Alfred Lyall on the general subject of irrigation in India in which he describes the great benefits conferred upon the inhabitants of vast districts where, in some years, rainfall is sparse or fails completely. He shows the necessity for scientific regulation of the development and maintenance of irrigation works; describes the regime of the two principal irrigation systems in India, (I) the diversion of the water of rivers into canals and (2) the accumulation in reservoirs or cisterns of water flowing off the lands after important rainfall; compares the two irrigation systems and treats of the topographic influences that affect the extent and the distribution of irrigation.                 Four sections give the irrigation laws in force in various parts of India. On each page under the French text is printed the English original. India has 510 pages and the concluding 93 pages are given to the regime of irrigation in other countries above noted and the laws relating to them.                 This book relating to a part of the world where scientific irrigation is already far advanced cannot fail to be useful in other countries which have only recently began to develop irrigation on a large scale.                 The Cherokee Indians. With Special Reference to their Relations                 with the United States Government. By Thomas Valentine Parker. viii and ii6 pp . Sketch Mlap, Illustrations and Bibliography. The Grafton Press, New York, 1907. (Price, $1.25.)                 The author s aim is to exhibit the policies of the Federal Government in its treatment, during more than a century, of the Cherokees. He sets forth the story of blunder, injustice, and dishonesty that marked the Government's relations with these Indians. He tells of their final removal by compulsion from the small part of their original territory still left to them and how 4,000 of them perished during the terrible march to the Indian Territory.                 Even in the earliest days of the Republic, the Cherokees were probably the most intelligent Indian nation and farther advanced in civilization than any other. The promise of their future, however, did not save them from the bitterest injustice. But the years of strife are finally over and the Cherokees will start anew, each as the owner of a bit of land; and when these Indians are enrolled among the citizens of the State of Oklahoma the end of their stormy history may be reached. To all who wish to judge for themselves of the relations between the Cherokees and our Government, this narrative, written both with sympathy and impartiality, is to be highly commended.                 Elismakunde. 1 Allgemeine Klimalehre. Von Prof. Dr. W. Koppen.                 Second, improved Edition. 132 pp., 7 Tables, 2 Figures, and Index. G. J. Gaschen'sche Verlagshandlung, Leipzig, i906. (Price, So pf.)                 This little work appears in the excellent ""Sammlung Goschen."" The seven chapters treat of the content of climatology, meteorological observations, climatic research, factors, types, zones, water vapour, etc. A list of the best works of reference is given. At once a scientific work and adapted for the general reader.                 What Rome Was Built With. A Description of the Stpnes Em-                 ployed in Ancient Times for Its Building and Decoration. By Mary Winearls Porter. viii and ioS pp., Indices and Works of Refer- ence. Henry Frowde, London and Oxford, 1907.                 The Romans were long content to use volcanic tuff, travertine, basaltic lavas and other Italian rocks in their edifices. Later the passion for beautiful marbles became almost a craze. Wealthy men were ever in search of new and beautiful stones with which to embellish their city.                 The author has ransacked literature for all it will yield relating to the rock materials used in the building of Rome in ancient times and later. The  to Rome observes the beauty and variety of decorative and building stones. This little book tells what these stones are, gives something of their history, and traces them to.their places of origin. Many of the finest rocks were brought from inner Egypt, from Algeria and Tunis, from France, Greece, and Turkey. Many of Pliny's bitter words, in his scorn of contemporary luxury, relate to Rome's enormous expenditures for beautiful stones. One of the most interesting sections relates to the development of the Carrara marble industry. The author chose a unique and edifying topic and has treated it in an interesting and adequate manner.                 Etudes Geologiques dans le Nord de Madagascar. Contributions                 & l Histoire Gdologique de l Oc6an l dien. Par Paul Lemoine. 520 pp., Maps, Illustrations, and Index. A. Hermann, Paris, i9o6. (Price,                 25 frg.)                 The French Ministry of Colonies sent Dr. Lemoine in 1902 to study the geology of the north of Madagascar. The island being as large as France, Belgium, and the Netherlands together, it is not to be expected that adequate knowledge of its geology will be the work of one man. Field studies will result in a series of monographs by different authors.                 Dr. Lemoine's studies extended from Port Loky on the vest coast to Analalava on the east coast. His work was considerably embarrassed by lack of good maps on which to base his observations. Upon his return to France, therefore, he made entirely new maps based upon the later government map on a scale of I :i,ooo,ooo which was more exact than the official map he had used in the field. His maps, admirably produced, are among the fine results of the work.                 After giving concisely the history of geological investigation in Madagascar and a bibliography of the resulting writings, Dr. Lemoine presents a geographi- cal description of the region in which he laboured. He then discusses the distri- bution in his field of the geological formations from the primary to the most recent, including the latest eruptive rocks. Each section ends with a statement of what is known of the occurrence in other parts of Madagascar of the formation described in the section. This discussion, filling 278 pages, gives a complete view of the geology of the northern part of the island.                 It is followed by a chapter on applied geology. Coal is lacking, but abundant vater power will supply electrical energy. A chemical analysis of the clays and limestones shows a large amount of material for the brick, cement, and lime in- dustries.                 The second part of the work deals with the geological history of the Indian Ocean. The author endeavours to establish by zoo-geographical considerations the ancient continental relations of Madagascar with other lands. Dr. Lemoine is to be congratulated upon the result of his arduous labours in a virgin field.                 Bulgaria of To-day. xv and 299 pp., 38 half-tone Illustrations, Map. and                 Commercial Diagrams. Ministry of Commerce and Agriculture, Bulgaria, Lon- don, 1907.                 The book was prepared by the Bulgarian Government for the Balkan States Exhibition at Earl's Court, London, in %907. It is an excellent resume of the geography, resources, and activities of Bulgaria, which has made wonderful progress in her independent existence during a quarter of a century. The geo- graphical account of the country is to be criticised in one respect. Adequate geographical descriptions are based upon geology, and this volume contains no reference to the geology of Bulgaria.                 Part x deals with the country and its population, sketches the history of the nation, describes the political organization, public instruction, the Bulgarian Church and other religions. Part 2 is devoted to economic conditions and de- velopment. The book is to be commended as a full and authoritative account of the Bulgaria of the present time.                 The Value of Pure Water. By George C. Whipple. viii and S4 pp.                 John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1go7. (Price, Sr.)                 The book deals with problems of-practical importance and great public inter- est. It is based upon the proposition that pure, as compared with impure, water has real financial value which may be measured by computing what impure water costs the community. The leading characteristics which affect the value of water to the consumer are its sanitary quality, its attractiveness, and its hardness.                 The author suggests a formula for the computation of the effect of the sani- tary quality of water on its financial value, based on the financial value of the lives lost by typhoid fever; a formula for computing the effect of the general at-  of water on its value, based on the physical characteristics of tur- , colour and odour; and a formula for computing the effect of the hard- ness of water on its value to consumers based on the use of soap in the household.                 He does not claim that his formulas have scientific accuracy, for some of his assumptions have not been established beyond doubt; but the general conclu- sions are not far out of the way and he certainly presents ample proof that an impure water supply not only affects the health and comforts of a community but also the pocketbooks of the people.                 Thus he shows that, aside from all humanitarian considerations, no city can financially afford to distribute an impure water supply; that a water supply which is attractive in appearance, taste and odour, is of material advantage on the financial side; and that the economic advantages gained by correcting the hard- ness of  are very great. In brief, he demonstrates the possibility of com- puting the value of pure water in dollars and cents and shows that the financial value of filtration justifies its cost. He illustrates, in conclusion, the disadvantage of the use of hard water in the household, the industries, and in steam making.                 Human life cannot be estimated in dollars and cents, but the financial basis is involved in all questions relating to public utilities; and, apart from this striking method of treating the water question on the financial side, the book is educational in its clear setting forth of the qualities that make water impure, the evil effects that follow the use of such water, and the benefits and cost of filtra- tion.                 Wanderings in Arabia. By Charles M. Doughty. Arranged with                 Introduction by Edward Garnett. Two vols. xx and 309 pp., and x and 292 pp., Glossary of Arabic Terms, MIap and Portrait. Imported by Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, 190g. (Price, $i4.50.)                 An abridgment of Doughty's ""Travels in Arabia Deserta,"" published nearly twenty years ago and the classic of English literature relating to Central Arabia. The book is a mine of information concerning many phases of the scientific study of Arabia, but the general public has scarcely come into contact with it.                 This republication deserves a hearty welcome, for the larger book is out of print and the shorter one should attract a wide circle of readers to Doughty's unique and fascinating narrative. Mr. Garnett truly says that Doughty's work stands among the great travel books in our literature. Doughty wandered among the Beduins, tenting in the steppes and deserts, studying the life of the oasis towns, seeing everything and describing it in a style which has been referred to as ""stately Elizabethan."" The reader may not be drawn to his quaint and old- fashioned diction, but it was a part of the man and gave vividness to every picture he drew. Here are a few lines from his description of the returning desert day:                 Tire desert day returning from the easts warns. the Beduin awake, who rises to his prayers; or it may be. unwitting of the form, he will but murmur toward heaven the supplication of his fearful human nature and say, "" Ah Lord my God ! "" and. i' Oh that this day may be fortunate; give Thou that we see not the evil! "" Of daily food they have not half enough. and if any head of the tattle be taken!- how may his household yet live? Rye and bye the herdsman is  and his beasts are  far from his sight.                 No sweet chittering of birds greets the coming of the desert life, besides man there is no voice in this waste drought. The Beduins, that lay down in their  upon the sandy mother-earth in the , hardly before the middle night, are already up and bestirring themselves. In every coffee-  s tent there is new fire blown in the hearth, and he sets on his co-ee pots, then snatching a coal in his fingers he will lay it in his tobacco pipe. (Vol. 1, p. 93,)                 The stamp of genius and insight is impressed on every page of Doughty's work and his book belongs as well to literature as to geography. This repro- duction, less unwieldly than the original, is an event of no small interest.                 Les Projections Cartographiques. Par Ch. Duchesne. vii and 202                 pp., Bibliography, and Tables. Acaddmie Royale de Belgique, Brussels, 1907.                 A technical treatment of map projections showing their mathematical develop- ment, the cartographic purposes which each is best adapted to serve and also the mathematical problems suggested by the study of projections.                 Die bayerischen Kartenwerke in ihren mathematischen Grund-                 lagen. Von Karl Then. viii and 192 pp., 43 Figures,; Maps, and Index. R. Oldenbourg, Munich and Berlin, 1905. (Price, Al. 4.30.)                 The writer is an official in the Topographic Bureau of the Bavarian Govern- ment. His book is in use in the mathematical section of the cartographic service as a practical and theoretical guide. An introductory chapter treats briefly of the significance, scope and problems of cartography. Most of the work is di- vided into two parts, the first containing a detailed discussion of map projections (121 pp.) and the second a description of the methods and the instruments used in cartographic surveying (58 pp.). Many diagrams and mathematical demon- strations are employed.                 Der Vulkanismus. Von Dr. Waither von Knebel. 128 pp., 3 Coloured                 Plates, Illustrations in the Text, Diagrams, Bibliography, and Index. A. WV. Zickfeldt, Osterwieck und Leipzig, 1907. (?) (Price, M. 1.75.)                 The book deals first with the results of field study of volcanic activity and secondly with theories as to the origin, various modes of action, and meaning of vulcanism. The author conducts his readers from one volcanic field to another for the purpose of observing and collecting facts. He discusses the question ""What is a volcano?"" treats of their distribution, the phenomena that accompany volcanic outbursts, volcanic explosions, lava and lava and gas eruptions, and calderas. All this and other information is given in the course of descriptions of these phenomena as they have been observed. The theoretical part of his sub. ject is treated in the concluding chapters and many hints are given as to what and how to observe: The volume is highly to be commended to the general reader and the teacher. It is strikingly illustrated with pictures and a map showing the distribution of younger volcanoes, some of which are now extinct.                 River Discharge. By John Clayton Hoyt and Nathan Clifford                 Grover. viii and 137 pp., Map, Illustrations, Tables, Diagrams, and Index. John Wiley & Sons, New York, and Chapman & Hall, London, r907. (Price, $2.) Prepared for the use of engineers and students. The book gives the fullest information as to the methods of measuring stream flow and the interpretation of the data collected. This information has been so widely scattered in engineering periodicals and government reports that it was not easily accessible. The work therefore is especially timely when so much attention is being given to the flow of streams. The student as well as the engineer may fully profit by its contents.

By Carl Van Doren                 EIGHT or ten years ago American                 poetry began to look up. It dis- covered that verse to be sweet did not need forever to wear the mildew of Tennysonianism, or to be strong did not need to keep on forever blowing the very brazen bugle of Rudyard Kipling. It experimented, it aspired, it used its brains-and it was read.                 One knew that sooner or later the novelists would follow after. It looks now as if they were taking over the primacy of interest in native litera- ture, if not the primacy of excellence. The year 1920 was a year to set down in the annals of the novel; so has 1921 been. And the second of these years has this importance: it shows signs of varying the single tone on which the revival of fiction began. Natural- ism, it seems, is not to be the only school. Here is Donn Byrne letting his fancy run, in a very Celtic cloak, across the centuries and the continents with Marco Polo to love and win and lose Golden Bells, daughter of Kubla Khan. Here is Robert Nathan set- tling his imagination in a dainty vil- lage and delicately building up a story almost as full of sugar and spice as the nice little girls of the nursery rhyme. And here is Edward Alden Jewell blithely disregarding the war and the times and returning to the perennial theme of youth at play in Paris.                 Youth with him plays very innocent- ly, a reputable pension the scene of its activities and its hero Kenneth the amiable yet knowing boy who skylarks                 with the inflammable hearts of the middle-aged  and in the end, instead of finding a sweetheart, finds a mother and takes a swim. As a whole the book is not so clear as it might have been made; part of the time it suggests the whimsical heroics of Leonard Merrick or of William J. Locke; and part of the time it sug- gests a parody of that romantic fic- tion in which plots are laid and de- tected, villains and adventuresses en- couraged through many chapters and then properly labeled and punished in the final chapter. But ""The Charmed Circle"" suggests neither of these kinds too much. It is gay in its own way, clever in its own way, touching in its own way. The ancient Cassienda everlastingly nibbling at her turnips; Bromley the Voeuf with his entangled interests in the street cars of Athens and the fair sex of all lands; the so sensitive Mrs. Brathers, with her lan-  and her longings and her per-  and her strong waters on the side; Cyprienne of the opera with her color schemes of saffron and sil- ver-grey and sapphire blue, and her enchanting mystery; Kenneth him- self, so demure at the Pension Bernard and yet so masterful in Montmartre- these and the various minor figures and their brisk careers, if they do not always fall into completely lucid pat- tern, yet in their own right are all amusingly seen and very deftly re- corded.                 What gives the book its highest quality, however, is the skill with which it has caught the color and per- fume of Paris-of Paris as seen through the eye of the affectionate                 and remembered by them when all the more barbarous splendors of other cities fade from the recollection. As regards this Mr. Jewell is probably orthodox: believing, it may be hoped, that Paris is after all the most civil- ized community in the world, and therefore the most varied, the most intense, the most profitable for a sophomore like Kenneth to have his joyful fling in.

The general character of this work was described in a previous number of the REvIEW in connection with a notice of the first fasciculus. Of the two portions here presented the first contains the essays (prepared for the celebration of the fifteenth centenary of the saint s death) relating to the liturgy of Chrysostocn, the                 origin and development of the liturgy and of its texts (Greek, Armenian, Arabic), the Byzantine liturgy in the Melkite Patriarchcates, (Alexandria, Antioch, Jerusalem), the various versions (Roumanian, Syriac, Slavic, the Ruthenian modifications).                 The third, the concluding fasciculus, contains besides the Greek text of a hitherto unpublished discourse on the chains of St. Peter, attributed to St. Chrysostom, two papers on the cult and the iconography of the saint and an elaborate dissertation on the remains and various sacred relics pertaining to him.                 The three  are paged to bind into one stately quarto-a volume that both for its wealth of biographical and historical material as well as for the splendid form in which it is presented is a worthy tribute to the memory of the saintly hero to whom it is dedicated and a monument to the scholarship and munificence of the authors and the makers of the work.

St. Chrysostom pronounced woman to be ""' a necessary evil, a natural temp- tation, a desirable calamity, a domestic peril, a                 deadly fascination, and a painted ill."" Chivalry arose, creating an ideal womanhood that stirred the imagination and the poetic fancy, and then raised it to a pinnacle where it was impossible for the actual woman to remain. Thus, both priest and knight did woman a great wrong. Whether as the "" painted ill"" of the Father's imagination, or as the immaculate star of the romanticist, she was equally cut off from all chance of development.                 Whatever the faults of the present age, it is under no delusions with regard to the humanity                 * WoMEN NG EIN(siE LIFE, FROM  TO MODERN Timxs. By Georgiana Hill. In two volumes. New York: The Macmillan Company.                 of woman. There are few trials, difficulties, or  that she escapes on the score of sex. She is not considered incapable of bearing a part in the common life of the world on account of any ethereal qualities, nor is she held up before men s eyes as a temptation to be made war upon. In the place of mere gallantry on the part of men, and coquetry on the part of women, there is now the simpler and healthier relation of comradeship.                 Except in the case of the sovereigns and a few heads of great families, English historians have given little attention to the place held by women as factors in the life of the nation. Accordingly the new book on ""1 Women in En- glish Life,"" by Miss Georgiana Hill, covers an almost new field. In it are depicted the chief causes and consequences of changes in the status of women, prominence being given to domestic life, as embracing the larger number and as not having been summed up in the nu- merous accounts of noteworthy women.                 The position of women in England cannot be regarded as an orderly evolution. It does not show unvarying progress from age to age. There have been breaks and gaps in the gen- eral advance, so that certain periods appear at a disadvantage in comparison with their pre- . For example, in the old days of feudalism, it is evident that in the eye of the law women ranked on an equality with men. Narrow as was the view taken by legislators of their industrial life, and absurd as many of their enactments seem now, it was reserved for modern times to set up an artificial barrier be- tween the sexes, to push the working woman down a step, and rank her with children and "" young persons."" The ancient guilds knew no distinctions of sex. They were formed in the interest of the trading community, for purposes of mutual help, and were as much for the ben- efit of the ""  "" as the ""1 bretheren."" The attitude of these early guilds toward women was essentially different from that of the mod- ern trade unions, and more liberal. In their ordinances relating to labor, everywhere the principle of equality is apparent. Not until later did the theory arise that women are com- petitors, not co-workers with men, and that it is better for women to be dependent upon their male relatives than to make their own way in the world - a theory which still has its sup- porters, but is having much trouble to hold its own in the face of a surplus female population, and certain other insistent facts.                 Another curious variation in public senti-                 ment appears in regard to learning. In the sixteenth century, learning among women was held in high esteem; in the eighteenth, it was counted something to be ashamed of; in the nineteenth, it again finds favor. During En. gland s great literary renaissance of the six- teenth century, women stand out prominently among the ranks of scholars. It was not thought unfeminine to speak good Latin, write correct Greek, or translate from the Hebrew. To be sure, they had the advantage of having their attention concentrated on a few subjects. There was less arithmetic and history and geography taught than is now imparted in the district schoolhouse. The curriculum of a lady of rank did not include many things that have now be- come matters of common knowledge among the children of the working-class. On the other hand, the education, if narrow according to modern ideas, was thorough; without the stim- ulus of college life, competitive examinations, or the prospect of rewards and honors in the shape of degrees, the attainments of women in the sixteenth century, in the subjects to which they had access, were of a high order; and their knowledge of the classics was more inti- mate and exact than that produced by the higher education of the present day.                 After the rigorous and healthy awakening in the time of the Tudors, a period of reaction set in. The seventeenth century combined all the faults of all the ages -laxity of morals, indifference to high aims, together with relig- ious fanaticism and a lack of appreciation of knowledge and learning. By that time, Shake- speare was considered out of date and vulgar by an age of fops and elegantes who could read Wycherley without blushing. James I., though a professed pedant, was adverse in every way to the progress of women. He treated them as inferiors, with ponderous levity, and nothing was further from his mind than the giving of any encouragement to the cultivation of learn- ing among the ladies of his court. One scholar, writing to the Duchess of Newcastle, speaks of authorship as an "" inferior employment,"" un- meet for the rank and qualities of a lady like her Grace.                 The Puritan movement served to retard the intellectual advance of women. Under the sway of Puritanism, women were taught that all na- ture s gifts to mind or body were so many snares, and that true life consisted in crushing out all aims and desires not connected with the saving of the soul. A catch, a song, a dance, were looked upon as destructive of modesty, and only                 fitted ""1 for them that live in the lusts of the world."" It was little wonder that, with learn- ing at a discount, and accomplishments de- nounced as sinful, women became frivolous and narrow. The light-hearted, in rebellion against the austerities of their Puritan neighbors, plunged into excesses, and the more serious subsided into a round of domestic drudgery.                 Far back in the days of the Lancastrians may be traced the progenitors of the political woman. They did not shrink from - rials"" and ""petitions,"" even when these in- volved a good deal of publicity. Everything that concerned their families or the common- weal they felt to be within their ""1 sphere,"" and the idea that politics was the concern of one sex alone had no place in their minds. That complex creature known as "" the NewWoman,"" to whom is ascribed, among other things, an unfeminine taste for politics, is not so modern after all.                 Arriving at a view of women in the Victo- rian Era, we are shown what English women have done and are doing as travellers and ex- , in literature, art, trade, business, as factory hands, domestic servants, nurses, doc- tors, and in public and political life. Plainly, the Victorian age resembles the Elizabethan in being a time when the nation has cast its intel- lectual shell and become a new creature. Fam- ily and social life are affected as much as intel- lectual progress. The conception of woman s place in society has undergone a process of re- making in this century. Domestic life has so changed that the old role of the wife as the home-keeper must be modified. To spend the best hours of the day in what is called "" look- ing after the house "" is an anomaly in the pres- ent stage of civilization. In olden times, women had to superintend and take part in a dozen operations that are now performed in factories and workshops, and of which the modern house- wife sees only the results. Many women who are not compelled to earn a living prefer to assume some daily outside occupation that en- ables them to keep up a more luxurious  and releases them from the  of sewing and household work, and gives them also some definite purpose and interest. The many ex- cellent folk who tremble lest the world shall suffer from the adoption by women of modes of life unsanctioned by tradition may be consoled by the reflection that Nature is stronger than fashion or opinion, and will at once make her voice heard whenever the lightest of her laws is                 transgressed.

All her life after she reached maturity was a preparation for this, its crowning achievement, and biographical history has no more eloquent record of self- sacrifice, courage, and devotion to noble causes than that of this brave, tender, and true woman.                 Clara Barton was a Christmas gift, in 1821, to her par- ents, Captain Steplhen and Dolly (Stone) Barton, who re- sided in North Oxford, Massachusetts. She came of "" fight- ing stock,"" for ber father was a valiant soldier under "" Mad Anthony"" Wayne in 1812, just a century ago, and her ma- ternal grandfather was one of the heroes of Bennington in the Revolutionary War. It is a beautiful antithesis that, while the ancestors helped to carry on war, their descendant gave her life to mitigating its horrors. Girls had few op- portunities for education eighty years ago, but she made the best of these, and at sixteen was herself a  She was ambitious, however, and carefully saved her small earnings until she had enough to take a course at Clinton, New Jersey, which had one of the best seminaries of that time for young women. Going from here to Hlightstown, New Jersey, she taught for some time with much success in a private school. Later she went to. Bordentown, and in the face of much op- position carried out a cherished plan of founding a free public school, which was almost the rst in that State. Tn one year she saw it increase from six to six hundred pupils and secured the building of a new school-house costing four thousand dollars.                 After a few years Miss Barton's health, never very robust, suffered under the strain, and in 1854 she went to Washing- ton to find a milder climate. At this time there was much confusion in the ITnited States Patent Office; clerks had betrayed the secrets of inventors and there was a general lack of confidence. The Commissioner of Patents, who knew Miss Barton personally, persuaded her to take the position of confidential secretary. She was the first woman publicly ,employed in a government department, and the male clerks were  indignant. They were rude and insubordinate, insulted and slandered , and tried in every way to drive her out of the office, but they did not know her firm and dauntless spirit. With remarkable executive ability she brought order out of chaos, and eventually raised the stand- ard of honor and loyalty in the department to a point it had never before attained. The Republican party came into power about this time, and the antislavery question was growing very acute. Miss Barton, a Massachusetts woman,  felt a strong interest in this new party, which she did not hesitate to express, and for this she was discharged from her position bv President Buchanan, but her services had become so  that finally she was recalled.                 At last, in 1861, the Civil War began and Miss Barton's sole thought became, ""H How can I best serve my country?"" The first wounded soldiers, forty men of the Sixth Massa- chusetts Volunteers, injured in the Baltimore attack of April 19th, were brought to Washington, and she hastened to their relief. She saw at once the great need of woman s help in nursing, feeding, and caring for the sick and wounded, and from that moment she consecrated herself to this work as long as the war should last. Women never had been permitted in hospitals, camps, or on battle-fields, and officials, military and civil, declined her services, really not knowing how to accept them. In her own unequaled manner she suc. ceeded in gaining the confidence of the commanding officers, and  made her way to the front, where the situation was terrible. As soon as it was known she was there sup-  sent to 'her care poured into Washington, first from her own State and then from many others. Her wonderful work under the most distressing conditions in a short time gained for her the name "" Angel of the Battle-field."" By her quiet self-reliance and her prompt decision she obtained so large and complete a recognition that camp and hospital                 supplies, a corps of assistants, and even military trains were placed at her service. During the four years of the war she was present on sixteen battle-fields, including  of Cedar Mountain, Fort Wagner, Petersburg, the second BujI Run, the Wilderness, and Antietam, for a long time in the hospitals about Richmond, and eight months at the siege of Charleston. She was always calm, cheerful, well poised, and philosophical, but strict, firm, and unflinching in main- taining authority.                 The close of the war did not end Miss Barton's labors. During the long years of its excitement and confusion many of the soldiers who died in the battles and the prisons had been placed in unmarked graves. Thousands of agonized letters from distracted relatives flooded the War Depart- ment, but as it had no information to give they remained unanswered. This situation aroused in Miss Barton not only a feeling of deepest pity, but a sense of great injustice that men hadl been called by their Government, patriotically given up by their families, and then no response made to the inquiry as to what it had done with them. Of these 80,000 were on the rolls simply as"" missing."" Miss Barton carried personally to President Lincoln her request that she might be allowed to receive and reply officially to these letters. He answered by announcing to the country that she would do this and directing that all such correspondence be ad- dressed to her. This resulted in what is known historically as "" The Search for the Missing Men.                 A bureau was at once established by Miss Barton and lists were carefully compiled from the hospital and prison rolls. Among the most noted of these prisons was that at Andersonville, Georgia, where 13,000 died in one year. The keeping of the daily record of the dead had been assigned by the Confederate authorities to a young Union prisoner, Dorance Atwiler, of Connecticut, who had been wise enough to preserve a copy of these records on scraps of paper which he had managed to secure, and these were of invaluable assistance. As the bodies had been placed in shallow , it was necessary that the work of disinterment and identification should be done before the fall rains began. Secretary Stanton detailed a force of men to accompany her, and on a little steamer loaded with head-markers Miss Bar- ton set out for Andersonvl.le. Here she spent the hot sum- mer of 1865, living in a tent, and, under her supervision,                 13,000 bodies were located and each placed in a grave four feet deep with a marker at the heEd. And then 400 graves of the Confederate dead were also carefully marked. In describing this work a few years ago at a patriotic gather- ing Miss Barton said: "" When all was finished I pulled the rope which raised the Stars and Stripes above the place for the first time-and I never have seen Andersonville since !""                 For four years, in the seasons when the weather permitted, Miss Barton continued this most trying task, and by her skill in following clues she located and marked the graves of over 20,000 UJnion soldiers, whose last resting-place, but for her brave and devoted service, would have forever remained unknown. For this she did not hesitate to use her own private funds, as there were no others available, and out of these she maintained an office in Washington and a force of twelve men. Finally Congress began to make some in- , and one day a delegation came to see her-Senator Wilson of Massachusetts, chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs and afterward Vice-President; Colfax of Indiana, Speaker of the House; Senator Wade of Ohio; Senator Grimes of Iowa; and young Representative Allison, later the well-known Senator. They found Miss Barton surrounded by thousands of letters and records, conducting the work according to her  simple but accurate system. They learned that she had already expended $8,000 of her own money and had not yet reached the end of her great undertaking. As thev realized what this quiet, unassuming woman had done and was doing they could not keep back the tears.                 When the Thirty-seventh Congress assembled it passed the following resolution:                 ""Wherea8, Mtiss Clara Barton has expended from her own resources large sums of money in endeavoring to discover missing soldiers of the U. S. Army, and in communicating intelligence to their relatives,. therefore                 ""Re8, by the Senate and House of Representatives that the sum of $15,000 be appropriated to reimburse Miss Barton and to aid in the further prosecution of the search; and that the printing necessary for the furtherance of this object shall be done by the public printer.""                 This, therefore, was not recompense for services, it was reimbursement for money expended by a private citizen for public uses. It was without solicitation on Miss Barton's                 part, who never asked for remuneration and never desired pav for her work for humanity.                 Miss Barton's fame had become national, and everywhere the people, whose hearts were filled with grateful apprecia- tion, were so anxious to hear of her experiences that at last she engaged with a lecture bureau, and for three years, during the winter months, she spoke throughout the country. Hundreds of thousands came to listen, to weep, and to ap- plaud. She was among the most highly paid lecturers of that time, including John B. Gough, Wendell Phillips, Mrs. Livermore, Mrs. Stanton, and others. Her profits enabled her to lay aside about $25,000, which she found very useful in her later work.                 It is not surprising that by the autumn of 1869 Miss Bar- ton was almost worn out. Her physicians, feeling that she never would cease work if she remained in this country, sent her to Europe for a complete rest. She went to Geneva, Switzerland, and from that visit dates the beginning of the Red Cross in the IJnited States.                 Ten years previous the agitation had begun for some means of mitigating the dreadful suffering of sick and wounded soldiers, as terrible a result of war as the actual deaths in battle. A book written by Henri Dunant, of Geneva, describing the awful conditions on the field of Sol- ferino, had stirred the civilized world. Meetings were called, committees formed, conferences held, and  a great convention was arranged to assemble in Geneva in 1864 to learn the results of the investigations made by - rians in many lands, and Switzerland officially invited all governments to send representatives. At this most impor- tant convocation, known as the "" Convention of Geneva,"" almost every government was represented except the United States; but this country was then in the midst of one of the most fearful waris in history, which left no thought for oc-  in other parts of the world.                 As a consensus of the wisdom and humanity of many nations ten articles of agreement were adopted to be known for all time as "" The Treaty of Geneva for the Relief of Sick and Wounded Soldiers."" Twelve governments affixed their official signatures to this document August 22, 1864. This treaty, to express it briefly, provides that all wounded or sick soldiers, all surgeons and nurses attending them, all hospitals and their supplies, shall be held neutral by both                 armies and shall not be captured by either; that citizens properly authorized shall be permitted to go on the field of battle, carry provisions and other relief, and work as they would among suffering people elsewhere; that badly wounded men shall not be held as prisoners, but must be sent back to their own army; that inhabitants of the place where a battle is fought may bring help to the wounded without being molested, nor shall their homes be disturbed if such soldiers are being cared for in them; that injured soldiers must not be regarded as enemies, but all must be attended to alike.                 As a distinguishing badge would be necessary, it was de- cided that out of compliment to Switzerland, the principal factor in creating this organization, her flag should be adopted with the colors reversed, and thus the red cross on a white field became the sign of the greatest humanitarian association the world has ever known. All other hospital flags were given up, and now any building over which it , any train or ambulance with this sign on its side, any doctor or nurse, any sick or wounded man with a Red Cross on the arm is absolutely sacred and must receive the pro- tection of friends and foes alike. This badge can be issued only by the military authorities. Every army now is closely followed by the Red Cross with everything which long ex- perience has shown will be needed when the emergency comes. Each country has its own central committee, and men and women work together, in some places men, in others women, taking the lead.                 This, in brief, is the history of the Red Cross. Ln a few years practically every nation had its society with one ex- ception; that was the United States! Why did this great, unselfish, charitable country, ahead of all others in humane practices, occupy this strange and anomalous position? The principal reason, as has been stated, was because when the society was organized it was in the throes of a long war and for vears afterward was trying to recover from its ef- fects. The proceedings of the Geneva convention were sent over here in a foreign language and in the stress and hurry of the time were not translated and published in the news- papers. In 1866 the Rev. Dr. HIenry Bellows, who was at the head of the relief work during the war, endeavored to interest the Government, but failed. The feeling seemed to be that never again would there be a war in this country,                 but, should one occur, it could organize sanitary commis- sions and other associations as had been done in the last conflict. After frequent efforts the International Committee became discouraged and made no further attempts to enlist the co-operation of the United States.                 This was the situation when Clara Barton went to Geneva in September, 1869. She found her fame had preceded her and at once the International Committee of Geneva called on her to ask why her country had not entered the Red Cross. She told them , like herself, the people were ignorant concerning it. They begged her to make herself acquainted with it, and as she continued her tour of Europe she studied its publications in French. The next summer she returned to Switzerland and was in Berne when war was declare(d between France and Germany. The Interna- tional Committee urged her to go into the field and see the practical working of the Red Cross in time of war. Al- though she had by no means recovered her health, she could not resist this appeal, and she was present during nearly all the battles of this fiercely fought war - at Hagenau, Metz, Strasbourg, Belfort, Woerth, in the Baden hos- pitals, at Montbelard, and then through the long Siege of Paris and the dreadful days of the Commune. During these two years she saw in all its grandeur the beneficent work of the Red Cross and the Treaty of Geneva, and she pledged herself to the nations of Europe that she would devote the rest of her life, -if necessary, to introducing and carrying forward this great institution in the United States.                 Miss Barton, however, had to pay the penalty for over- taxing nature and for several years was an almost helpless invalid. She did not fully recover her strength until 1877, and then her first effort was to carry out her pledge. She presented to President Hayes an eloquent letter from Presi- dent Moynier, of the International Committee, entreating that he would take the necessary steps to unite this country with the others in the sacred bonds of the Red Cross. It proved impossible to secure any action by this administra- tion and she had to content herself with patient, tactful, and untiring measures to interest persons of influence and power. Soon after President Garfield's inauguration, in 1881, she again presented her beloved cause, and he received it and her with much cordiality. He urged its favorable consid- eration by Sercetary of State James G. Blaine, who opened                 a correspondence with the International Committee and be- gan immediate arrangements to organize the Red Cross in the United States. That very summer occurred the tragic death of the President, but to Miss Barton's great joy his successor, President Arthur, continued these plans. On March 1, 1882, he proclaimed to the world that this country had entered into the Treaty of Geneva. President Moynier at once wrote Miss Barton: "" You must feel happy and proud at last to have attained your object, thanks to a per- severance and zeal which surmounted every obstacle."" In Geneva bonfires were lighted in celebration of the news that the United States had become a Red Cross nation. This is doubtless the only instance where an international treaty was brought about solely by one person, and that one a woman. Miss Barton was very properly made president, and she held this most responsible office for twenty-two years.                 I The United States had now the association, but its largest war had been over for many years, and it was hoped and believed that there would not be another for generations, if ever. This is, however, a country of great disasters in many other forms, and the resourceful mind of this woman- 'general realized that if the society were to justify its ex-                 it should have power to extend its aid in any national calamity. With that diplomacy of which she was past- master she brought those in authority to this belief, and when the treaty was presented to other nations for their ratification it contained this request. They willingly granted it and it became known as the ""American Amendment."" Many years passed before it was adopted by other countries, but now all of them have it in their treaties.                 The wisdom of this provision is apparent, for, in the quarter of a century which has passed, the United States has had only one small war-the Spanish-American-while the Red Cross has rendered invaluable aid in scores of calamities. The list of these is long, and includes the Michi- gan forest fires, Ohio and Mississippi River floods, cyclones in many States, the Texas famine, the great earthquakes, Florida yellow-fever epidemic, the memorable disaster at Johnstown, the South Carolina Islands hurricane, and the great tidal wave at Galveston. 'Twice the Red Cross has sent relief to the sufferers from famine in Russia; it went to the help of the Armenians after the massacre; it was first                 to relieve the distress of the Cuban "" ,"" and its services throughout the Spanish-American War are  fresh in memory. Our people always respond instantly and generously to all such appeals for help with thousands of dollars in money and thousands in supplies, but these are of small avail unless properly distributed, and this is the mis- sion of the Red Cross. At the first cry of distress its workers are on the field and there they remain till the last needed act of mercy has been accomplished. To all of these scenes '6f suffering Miss Barton went in person, with her devoted assistants, and remained for weeks and months, burying the dead, apportioning the supplies, feeding the hungry, cloth- ing the naked, nursing the sick, and helping rebuild the ruined homes. It would be impossible to enter into the details of this work. These are fully set forth in the many official reports of Miss Barton and her large and interesting book entitled The Red Cross int Peace and War. Nothing in fiction ever was so dramatic and thrilling. Here also is the long and entertaining story of the society s part in the war between Spain and the United States from the time it responded to the first call of the starving , in 1897, until their own flag of liberty floated over Cuba. The Red Cross knows neither race nor color, neither Cubans nor Spaniards. In 1898 the Spanish Government expressed its appreciation of Clara Barton in the "" Diploma of Grati- tude,"" a beautifully engrossed testimonial from the Supreme Assembly of the Red Cross of Spain for kindness and help to Spanish soldiers.                 In 1883 Miss Barton was appointed superintendent of the Reformatory Prison for Women at Sherborn, Massachusetts, by Governor B. F. Butler, but soon resigned the position. In 1885 she was made Special Commissioner for Foreign Exhibits at the New Orleans Exposition, but with these exceptions her life for thirty years was devoted to the Red Cross. For many years she made her home in Washington, where she provided a headquarters for the society from the time of its organization. Later she went to Glen Echo, a few miles away, attracted by the quiet and peace which left her undisturbed at the times when she could be at home. In a  and picturesque spot overlooking the Potomac she built a unique house after the fashion of the temporary structures used -by the Red Cross in its relief work. A wide hall extended the entire length, with a gallery looking down                 upon it from the second story, and into this hall and gallery all the rooms opened. Between the partitions were almost numberless cupboards and closets whose existence never would be suspected, and most of these were filled with books and Red Cross literature. The stone towers, vine-covered and apparently architectural features, were in reality fire- proof vaults for the protection of the important papers. Thus by personal care and at her own expense she preserved the records of the American Red Cross all the years.                 This quaint but pleasant and comfortable house was full of interest. Domestic and personal associations clustered about the old furniture, pictures, and china brought from her childhood home, while all around were reminders of a pub- lic life that was without a parallel. The walls were covered with the flags of all nations, gifts to Miss Barton-our own banner, the great eagle of Germany, the eagles of Austria, star and crescent of Turkey, the blue-and-white silken folds of Greece, the royal banners of Italy, Belgium, Norway, Sweden, and the flag of Switzerland voted to her by that Government. Everywhere were engrossed and - nated diplomas and testimonials from the German War Veterans, the Red Cross of Austria, the Sultan of Turkey, the Prince of Armenia, the Cortes of Spain, the Portuguese Red Cross, the Governor and Legislature of Texas-from all parts of the world. In cabinets were many jewels and decorations, including the Iron Cross of Prussia from Em-  William I. and Empress Augusta; G-old Cross of Remembrance and jewels from the Grand Duke and Grand Duchess of Baden; Red Cross from the Queen of Servia; decoration from the Queen of Spain; medals from potentates and societies without number.                 Miss Barton was five times appointed to represent this Government at international conferences of the Red Cross in Europe-at Geneva in 1884, Carlsruhe. in 1887, Rome in 1890, Vienna in 1897, Russia in 1902. At the last named she was received with marked distinction by the Tsar and Tsarina and the Empress Dowager, and although eighty- one years old she bore her full part in the duties of the conference. Notwithstanding the distinguished honors paid her by the sovereigns of Europe and eminent men and women of all countries, far beyond those ever conferred upon any other American woman, sbe was wholly without egotism or assurance, and so modest and reserved that she could not                 be persuaded by any means to talk about herself. It was only from her closest friends that one could secure the facts about her life in which an appreciative public had a right to be interested. She was too reticent, for toward the close of her life, when she shared the fate of all who have achieved fame and the effort was made to depose her from her high position, she scorned to enter into controversy. "" Let my life and my work speak for themselves,"" was her only an- swer to criticism, although she was deeply wounded. When she was convinced that the society which she had founded and sustained for so many years would pass into capable hands she gladly resigned the presidency and laid down the heavy burden.                 Although at this time eighty-four years old Miss Barton had no thought of ceasing from work; she purchased at Oxford, Massachusetts, near the home of her birth, a hand- some colonial house in which she expected to spend most of her time while still retaining the Glen Echo place. From here in 1905 she sent out to hundreds of friends her Christ- mas and birthday greeting, a little book of eight pages, con- taining her picture with a dainty cover of holly design. In this she outlined what she called "" My Later Work "" and said: "" This announcement will not surprise you. You have never known me without work and you never will. It has always been a part of the best religion I had. "" She referred to the Red Cross now wholly taken over by the Government as "" a finished effort "" and said: "" But this does not finish the need of help for the woes of the world about us. Another work reaches out its hands to me and I have taken them. The humane and the far-sighted are pressing to its standard-the standard of Organized First Aid to the Injured.""                 Miss Barton's plan, as afterward outlined, was to pro- vide a training for firemen, policemen, employees on rail- roads, ships, in all kinds of factories, which would enable them to know what appliances and remedies to use on the instant when accidents should occur. This training would be given also to the women of the  so that they too might be prepared for the emergencies which so often arise. This scheme, which, when put into general practice, would be as valuable as the Red Cross itself, was carefully worked out even to the selection of a: capable board of man- agement, and this new organization has already taken its place among the great humanitarian agencies of the world.                 Miss Barton was a strong advocate of woman suffrage, and, while she could not spare the time to make it a special part of her work, she always went to the national conventions when it was possible, occupied a seat on the platform, and bore strong testimony to her belief in the justice of this cause. She attended the convention in Baltimore in Feb- ruary, 1906, the last at which Miss Anthony was present, and in the course of her eloquent and touching remarks she said:                 ""A few days ago some one said in my presence that every woman in the world should stand with bared head before Susan B. Anthony. Be- fore I had time to think, I said, 'And every man as well.' I would not retract the words. I believe her work is more for the welfare of man than for that of woman herself. Man is trying to carry the burdens of the world alone. When he has the efficient help of woman he should be glad, and he will be. Just now it is new and strange, and men can- not comprehend what it would mean. But when such help comes, and men are used to it, they will be grateful for it. The change is not far away. This country is to know woman suffrage, and it will be a glad and proud ,day when it comes.""                 Age passed Miss Barton by, leaving but few traces of the many years. Her dark eyes were bright and her cheeks pink, while the brown hair parted smoothly over her fore- head had scarcely a thread of white. When she was eighty- four she offered her services and those of the Red Cross to both Russia and Japan and held herself in readiness to start for the Orient at the word of command. Almost to the last she kept a stenographer busy day after day answering the thousands of letters which came to her from all parts of the globe; she found constant employment for her own pen and supervised personally all the details of whatever work she was engaged in carrying forward.                 The nation will  that resolution passed by the Cen- tral Relief Committee of Texas after the Red Cross had ended its work for the sufferers from the storm at Galveston:                 ""Resolved, That we especially thank and render homage to the woman who is the life and spirit of the Red Cross; to her who is the embodiment of the saving principle of laying down one s life for one s friend, whose friend is the friendless and whose charge is the stricken; to her who should be exalted above queens and whose achievements are greater than the conquest of nations or the inventions of genius, and who is justly crowned in the evening of her life with the love and admiration of all humanity-Clara Barton.""

Greek nationality is a subject of growing interest among thoughtful men, and if, as is more than probahle, Greece is abhut to add a new and stirring chapter to the long story of her strugzles and achievements, her history may profitably he read from the Hellenic standpoint. With Grote and Curtius, the history of                 Greece as an autonomy ends with the battle of Chbmroneia, in 338 B. C., and the magnificent lion which once crowned the tuimulus on that meamorable fled was the memorial of a dead nationality.                 M\r. Timayenis is a Greek, and has written the history of his race with a profound hold upon its historic continuity. iHellenism, which Mr. Symonds declares was never territorial, but the intangible, pervasive spirit of the Greek race, be believes had definite geo. graphical limits, and still exists iu its integrity within the boundaries or modern G:eece. This cenuceptionof Greek history is radically divergent from that held by those historians wvhom the world has accepted as anthorlties, and in several Important particulars puts Mr. Timayenis in antagonism to the standard works in this department, and to opinions generally held by scholars. He sketches the early development of Greece with a bold, free hand, and by virtue perhaps of his race afilnity with the people of that far-off time, succeeds in giving to his narrative a color and freshness which one misses in other records of the same period. The sttuggle between Greece and Asia is told with uncommon vigor and vivacity, the descriptions of the great battles notably gaining in impressiveness and interest under a Greek hand. This human, sympathetic interest is one of the most striking features of this work, and recalls the remark that the history of a race ought always to be written by a man born of it. The glory of Athens under Pericles, and her transient successes and subsequent disasters In the Peloponnesian war, are outlined with considerable pictorial power; Mr. Timayenis taking issue with Grote on the question of responsibility for the struggle by throwing it on Athens. IHis estimate of the motives and character of Cleon is also at variance with the older historian.                 It is, however, his conception of Philip and Alexander and of the Macedonian conquest which emphasizes his divergence from the commonly accepted view of Greek national development. He claims for these conquerors or ancient Hlellas Hellenic descent and the Hellenic spirit. In his view they were no semi-barbarlaus, but members of a Greek tribe whose germs of culture under harder conditions bad been longer in coming to maturity, but who became, when the hour was ripe, the true representatives of Greek genius and spirit, destined to open a new and glorious chapter of Hellenic history and to extend almost im. measurably Its territorial limits and its Intellectual dominion. Demosthenes is no longer the eloquent statesman, staking his fate on the preservation of his country's liberty, but the mistaken and shortsighted patriot, blind to the true historical development of Greece, and unwisely provoking a hopeless struggle againstdestiny. This view isno'o likely to be generally accepted, but It is very skillfully set forth. The Macedonian conquest of Asia, and the consequent diffusion of Hellenism throughout.the East, are graphically described, and in their fullness and interest add not a little to the value of the work.                 - Tl;e narrative of the subsequent vicissitudes of the Greek race, or its decline under the Eastern empire and its restive bondage under Turkish rule, is hurried and unsatisfactory. The charge of plagiarism which some reviewers have brought against this part of Mr. Timayenis's work is utterly unwarranted in view of his frank acknowledgment of the use of authorities, but looseness of construction and a falling oil in literary Interest and power are unmistakable, and are doubtless due in great measure to haste. The recital of the struggle against Turkey out of which the modern kingdom of Greece had its birth, and a succinct account of subsequent progress and of the present status of Greece politically, commercially and intellectually, complete this unbroken survey of the Greek race from Its earliest appearance in history to the present time.                 The modern Greek MIr. Timayents regards as the lineal descendant of the men who fought at Marathon, built the Parthenon, conquered Asia, and gave the whole world an impulse toward freedom and beauty which has made all ages and nations their debtors. He rejects utterly the theory that Greece has been practically repopulated by fusion with and introduction of other and lower races, affirms that the only true settlement of the Eastern question involves the restoration of all                 A Hiftorv of Grcce from the Earliest Times to the Present.

Appleton & Co.                 their ancient territory to the Greeks and the surrender of Constantinople to their keeping, and believes that Greece still possesses within herself the elements or a vigorous national life. Such a view, picturesquely set fortb, will ivec great Interest for all who are following the course of events in the East. even if it falls to command their assent.                 Mr. Timayenis's history is very unequal in parts, as has been indicated, and Is occasionally marred by an exuberance of Greek complacency, but it has the striking merits of comprehensiveness, originality, pictur.squeness, and a cerlain contemporary interest, which make it very enteitaining to the general reader, without diminishing its value to the student.

The episode falls into three parts: the first, opening with a vivid account of the landing of Percy's regiment in Boston, characterizes the Earl and a  of his officers, and relates, as an extract from the (non-existent) journal of Captain William Glanville Evelyn of ""The King's Own,"" the conversation at one of the Earl's dinners; the second is concerned with the battles of Concord and Bunker Hill and the dark days that followed, when, for obvious reasons, "" dinner-giving was going out of fashion in Boston,"" and the evacuation of the town was only a matter of time; the third is in the nature of an after-piece,  briefly the future careers - in America, England, or India -of the gallant group of officers who had been  to gather around Earl Percy's hos- pitable board.                 The chief authorities for the more original features of the narrative are Earl Percy's own letters, those of Joluh Andrews, Mrs. Boscawen, Lady Sarah Bunbury, and others, and the files of the Boston newspapers of the day, - sources which are indicated in an appendix of notes. A complete bibliography would extend to alarm- ing proportions, and include every available book, pamphlet, and document; for it is evident that the easy,  manner of the narrative is due to the author s perfect acquaintance not only with the episodes which his book touches upon but also with the entire history of the period.                 In its main outlines, the story of the Boston siege is as familiar as any in our history; but with the stately Earl Percy in the foreground, in place of Paul Revere and the Concord minute- men, it takes on a fresh interest. The Earl wrote home of Boston, - its people, whom he called "" a set of sly, artful, hypocritical ,                 cruel, and cowards,"" and its climate, which took him to "" the Torrid and Frigid Zone frequently in the space of 24 hours."" In order that he might enjoy the scenery of the suburbs he bought a riding-horse, for which he paid ?450, and sent to New York ""' for a pair of chaise horses that were to his mind."" Then he rented a house, pleasantly situated Nvithin its garden at the head of Winter Street, and was ready to play the host "" to the officers of the Line and occasionally the Gentlemen of the Country.""                 I It is pleasant to see him crossing the Common each afternoon to do the honors of his mansion, and day by day and week by week it is interesting to watch his guests passing in and out the great door. It opens to officers in scarlet and gold, and to officers in the blue of the Royal Navy, to gentlemen in silk and brocade, and to gentlemen in velvet and lace. Old Dr. Cauer goes up the path leaning upon huis stick, the great coach of Colonel Royall lumbers up to the garden gate, the chaise of Judge Lee waits in Winter Street to carry his Honor back to Cambridge. All those who love the King within this stern old New England town rejoice in the polite  that brings them to Earl Percy's dinner-table.""                 At the particular dinner that Captain Evelyn describes, the civilian element was ably repre- sented by the Reverend Mather Byles, preacher, poet, and wit, arrant Tory and so "" in the eyes of the army the most sensible as well as the *nost delightful clergyman in Boston."" The other places were filled by army and navy officers, invited to meet Lord Percy's boy friend, young Roger Sheaffe, who is about sailing for England to study for a commission.                 The Earl has presented him to-night to his future comrades of the army, and the radiant face of the boy  be a  sight in his lordship s eyes.""                 Pleasant banter over the boy s ambition to "" wear the red coat"" runs around the table. Doctor Byles's witty sallies  old Major PitcairLi into convulsions of mirth. Local affairs, London scandal and literary gossip fur-  topics of conversation. The Earl, who pre- sides gracefully, asks Dr. Byles if he admires the verse of Dr. Goldsmith, lately deceased.                 Dr. Byles replied that he regarded Goldsmith as an ingenious man of excellent promise, though not to be compared with his old friend and correspondent, Mr. Pope.""                 Then Earl Percy spoke of his family s - tion with the poet, and Captain Harry Fox, Lord Holland's "" only good son,"" recalled his brother Charles's acquaintance with him.                 He feared that the poet s death had  hastened by the  of heavy debts. Here Gould muttered in  ear to wonder whether, if Lord Hollanid had not come to the financial relief of Charles Fox, that portly gambler would have been crushed. as easily as the Dutke's scribbling friend from Gruib Street.""                 It is all very courtly and care,free; but when the time for work comes these leisurely diners- out prove themselves excellent fighters. As for Earl Percy's scornful estimate of the colonists, he was prompt to revise it on the evidence of April nineteenth, in writing of which he paid high and generous  to their courage and perseverance. Mr. Murdock describes the Earl  his brigade on the  of that fateful day.                 "" Anld the  on his Lordship's fate is  the one we fild in Mr. Stuart's , nor that familiar to guests at his -table.""                 But the Earl and his friends were not yet discouraged. Dinner-giving went merrily on in Boston,  the choice of guests greatly  by the advent of many  loyalists and the arrival of the frigate Cerberus.                 "" One is  to glance  into the old - room and mark the niew faces  gather there, to hear Colonel Saltonstall and Mr. Vassall lament the -  of the time, to hear Clintoni tell his  of the fighting Prince of Brurnswick, and listen to Bur-  s graceful and racy recital of the gossip that is  high life in London.""                 But soon caine the disillusionment of Btunker Hill, and then, after a long cold winter - - ened chiefly by Burgoyne's wit as a playwright - the evacuation, and the scattering of Earl Percy's dinner- to the four corners of the earth. It is the best possible evidence of Mr. Murdock's art that we read of  careers with interest, anid part from them, after so slight an . as from friends.
