# Evaluating the Digitized Review via ProQuest 

Begin by clicking on "Open Link in New Tab." This should load a page with a teel banner that says ProQuest in the upper left hand corner. Below will be a menu, followed by  some bibliographical information, such as:

> D. Appleton & Company.

> The Literary World; a Monthly Review of Current Literature (1870-1904); Boston Vol. 32, Iss. 10,  (Oct 1, 1901): 152.

This information should match the review from the previous tab. Below this, there will be a window with a pdf in it. Note that you must be on Pitt's network for this link to display properly. 

# Coding the Review Category

Read and/or skim the review. Dtermine if it is a review of one work, a review of two or more works, or something that isn't a review. Choose the appropriate label under "Category." Here are some brief definitions:

- **Single-work Review**: One review of one book. The book may have multiple volumes and/or multiple authors 

- **Multi-work Review**: One review that mentions multiple books; for example https://search.proquest.com/docview/90059441

- **Non-Review Content:** Anything that isn't a book review. Common examples include author interviews, letters from readers, news from various publishers, etc. For example, see https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A00E6DD163EE733A25754C0A9679C946497D6CF

- **Brief or Mostly Quotes Review**: A review that is very sparse or heavily comprised of material from the reviewed book. The length cutoff is anything about 200 words or less. Use your best judgment; these will be cross-checked at a later date.  
- **Cluster of Reviews**: Thus category is reserved for a case when the podf contains more than one review, or a review plus other conent. Tagging a review as a cluster flags it for follow-up.  

# Presumed gender

There are five choices for this drop-down menu. Here are some brief definitions:

- **Presumed gender(s) male**: One or more authors, all described using male gendering terms such as Mr., Lord, Baron, he, and his.

- **Presumed gender(s) female**: One or more authors, all described using female gendering terms such as Mrs., Miss, madam, she, and her.

- **Presumed gender(s) mixed**: Two or more authors, at least one gendered with male terms, and at least one gendered with female terms.

- **Presumed gender(s) unknown or not used**: One or more authors, where a gender label is unclear, or maybe the reviewer avoided gender terms to remain neutral.

- **Not single-work Review**: Use this for any reviews tagged as multi-work, non-review, cluster, or brief.

# Reviewed book's title, date, publisher, etc.

If the review is anything besides a "Single Work Review," you can now click submit and then click "Keep Going" to call up another review. However, if it's a "Single Work Review," you should keep going. Here are some tips for each field:

- **Title**: This should be ovious from the review. It's often in a one- or two-line blurb at the very top or bottom of the first page.

- **Pub date**: If a pub year is stated, use that year. Otherwise, use the year of the published review. For example, in the example above from _The Literary World_, the date would be 1901

- **Publisher**: This chould be obvious, and in the one- or two-line blurb. If two or more publishers are given, use a semicolon to separate each one. For example, for http://search.proquest.com/docview/89659668/, the publisher info would be "John Murray; Charles Scribner's Sons"

- **Genre**: genre of the book, such as nonfiction, fiction, historical fiction, memoir, poetry, drama. I plan to develop a controlled vocabulary for this field but, for now, you may use any label that is meaningful to you.

- **Book price**: This information is in the one- or two-line blurb. If not, leave it blank. Write prices like "$5", $3.75 or "75 cents." Use spelled out words for foreign currency, such as "2 pounds" or "3 francs."

- **Author VIAF**: This field is the most difficult. Go to http://viaf.org/ and search using the author name from the review. If one of the results is clearly the right person based on their name, nationality, birth date, and published work, click on that entry. One the new page, locate and copy the field called "permalink." For example, Mark Twain's permalink is http://viaf.org/viaf/50566653. For two or more viafs, use a semicolon to separate each one. 

- **Author Name**: The reviewed author, as named in the review. If the review only ever calls the author "Mrs. Cleary," don't add the first name, even if it's obvious what it should be. Use the most detailed version of the name included in the review. If two or more authors are given, use a semicolon to separate each one. 

# That's it! Don't forget to click "Submit"!
